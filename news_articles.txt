Advertisement North Korean leader Kim Jong Un was seen riding in a tank during military exercises earlier this month in a show of force likely meant to counter the US-South Korea military exercises his regime has repeatedly denounced. Kim talked tough after the photo ops and brought along the person speculated to be a likely successor in North Korea's authoritarian dynasty. Advertisement Kim oversees firepower demonstrations North Korean leader Kim Jong Un sits inside a tank during a military demonstration. KCNA via Reuters The Korean People's Army demonstrated its firepower with an array of large-scale demonstrations. The drills included air and amphibious combat troops and "newly-equipped super-large" rocket launchers. The exercises also featured a new main battle tank. Many details of the exercises could not be confirmed due to the lack of independent observers, but images from the North Korean state-run news agency showed more than 60 self-propelled howitzers and multiple rocket launchers were part of the exercises, USNI News reported. Advertisement Preparing for 'merciless and rapid strikes' in the event of war North Korean leader Kim Jong Un holds a firearm at a major military operations base in the western region of the country. KCNA via Reuters The military drills came in response to the North Korean strongman calling to intensify "practical actual-war drills ensuring victory in a war," according to a report by Korean Central News Agency. Kim said the military exercises were "necessary" for all its artillery sub-units to prepare them to "take the initiative with merciless and rapid strikes at the moment of their entry into an actual war," per KCNA. Advertisement Rising tensions with South Korea North Korean leader Kim Jong Un gestures as he guides a military demonstration involving tank units in North Korea. KCNA via Reuters The military demonstrations come as North Korea ramps up tensions against South Korea . Earlier this year, Kim said the country's government would make a "decisive policy change" in its relations with its southern neighbor, potentially in a bid to justify future use of nuclear weapons against the South. "If they give up on peaceful unification and redefine South Korea as a hostile enemy country with no diplomatic relations, the contradiction of using nuclear weapons against the same people will be eliminated," Hong Min, a senior researcher at the Korea Institute for National Unification in Seoul, told Reuters. Shin Won-sik, Seoul's defense minister, said it would "constitute a war" if North Korea fired upon the South. Modernizing North Korea's armed forces Soldiers participate in a demonstration during the training of the Korean People's Army's air and amphibious combat units. KCNA via Reuters North Korean newspaper Rodong Sinmun, the official organ of the state's Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea, reported that the exercises focused on preparing troops for "unexpected wartime circumstances" as the North Korean leader works to modernize the country's armed forces. Advertisement Ready for 'full combat mobilization' Soldiers participate in a demonstration during the training of the Korean People's Army's air and amphibious combat units. KCNA via Reuters Following the large-scale exercises, Kim declared the military was ready for "full combat mobilization." "The destructive offensive means possessed by our army should more thoroughly fulfill their missions to block and suppress the possibility of war with the constant perfect preparedness to collapse the capital of the enemy and the structure of its military forces," Kim told the troops, according to KCNA. 'Fulfilling important military missions for war deterrence' A North Korean tank fires during a military demonstration. KCNA via Reuters "The drill started with the power demonstration firing of the long-range artillery sub-units near the border who have put the enemy's capital in their striking range and are fulfilling important military missions for war deterrence," according to a report by KCNA. Advertisement Parachuting paratroopers Soldiers are seen parachuting in the sky during a demonstration during the training of the Korean People's Army's air and amphibious combat units. KCNA via Reuters Photos released by KCNA showed North Korean tanks in a line firing during military demonstrations. Paratroopers are also seen parachuting out of large commercial cargo planes, NK News reported. Late last year, experts said North Korea appeared to have converted Air Koryo's Il-76 cargo planes into military aircraft, including an airborne warning system used to detect enemy missiles. In 2022, Air Koryo officials faced sanctions in response to aiding in nuclear tests run by North Korea. Advertisement Kim's likely successor attending military drills North Korean leader Kim Jong Un's daughter Kim Ju Ae looks through binoculars while standing beside her father and North Korean military personnel. KCNA via Reuters Kim's daughter Kim Ju Ae was also photographed attending the paratrooper drills. Ju Ae, who is believed to be about 10 or 11 years old, has made numerous appearances alongside her father  — the only one of his three children to do so — leading to the belief that he is prepping her to be his likely successor. "It would not be out of question for him to decide he wants his daughter to be next in line because he has shown his willingness to put women in positions of power," Ramon Pacecho Pardo, a professor of international relations at King's College London, told Business Insider's Tom Porter. Advertisement Coinciding with Freedom Shield 24 Military members salute during a military demonstration involving tank units in North Korea. KCNA via Reuters The North Korean military drills also coincided with joint exercises held by the US and South Korea, which included training on land, sea, and air, as well as operations to counter nuclear missiles. Forces from other United Nations countries took part in the annual military drills, called Freedom Shield 24 , including Australia, Belgium, Canada, Colombia, France, Great Britain, Greece, Italy, New Zealand, the Philippines, and Thailand. The exercises, which ran from March 4 to 14, are aimed at strengthening security and stability across Northeast Asia and the Indo-Pacific by fortifying "the combined defense posture and enhance Alliance response capabilities against a spectrum of security threats." Advertisement An 'undisguised' military threat Military helicopters fly above firing tanks during a military demonstration in North Korea. KCNA via Reuters North Korea's Ministry of National Defense released a statement denouncing the US-led joint military exercises "for getting more undisguised in their military threat to a sovereign state." "The armed forces of the DPRK will continue to watch the adventurist acts of the enemies and conduct responsible military activities to strongly control the unstable security environment on the Korean peninsula," according to the statement. Advertisement Resuming missile testing The Korean People's Army conducts an artillery firing drill. KCNA via Reuters Days after exercises for Freedom Shield 24 concluded, North Korea resumed its short-range ballistic missile tests on March 17. North Korea is banned from testing ballistic missiles by the UN Security Council. Russia was also reportedly using North Korean missiles in the war in Ukraine and collecting data on its performance with an arms deal between the two allies. A South Korean official described Ukraine as a "test site" for North Korean weapons . "The Kim regime's one-upmanship aims to show strength to its domestic audience, suggest costs on the Korean Peninsula for Seoul's international security cooperation, and warn Washington against increasing pressure on Pyongyang," Leif-Eric Easley, an associate professor of international studies at Seoul's Ewha University, told Al-Jazeera.

The Wall Street Journal reported on the unusual trend taking off in the country. Pet rocks were a popular joke gift in the 1970s US, when their creator, ad exec Gary Dahl, sold 1.5 million of them for about $4 each . Now the rocks seem to be back, but in Asia, where they aren't played for laughs. Advertisement Pet rock creator Gary Dahl. Bettmann/Getty Images Instead they are seen as a way to mitigate the loneliness and burnout spreading through South Korean society. The Journal's Jiyoung Sohn spoke to millennials turning to pet rocks to help them through difficult periods in their careers. Koo Ah-young, 33, told Sohn she didn't have anyone to talk to about the burnout she experienced after starting a new office job in Seoul. She didn't want to worry her friends and family, but she also felt that getting a pet animal, like a cat or dog, would have been too much responsibility. Advertisement So Koo got a pet rock and named it "Bang-bang-i," inspired by the Korean word for jumping in happiness, according to the Journal. She said she talks to the rock about her day and carries it in her pocket when going out for walks or to the gym. "There was some sense of serenity, knowing that this natural rock had weathered a lot over the course of time to reach its current state," she said. Related stories The coronavirus pandemic prompted a pet-rock boom in South Korea, according to a July 2023 report by Korea JoongAng Daily . Some South Koreans have used TikTok to showcase decorating their pet rock or unboxing them . Business Insider found well-reviewed rocks for sale on South Korea's Coupang e-commerce site for around $9. Advertisement The increase might be linked to the rise of single-person households — which accounts for the majority of all households in the country — as noted by The Korea Bizwire in 2021. South Korea's Ministry of Interior and Safety reported in December 2023 that the number of single-person households had increased from 9.72 million in 2022 to 9.93 million in 2023, The Korea Herald reported. And it's not just the average worker who has one — K-pop stars have their own celebrity rocks, including Yoon Jeonghan of the group Seventeen . Lonely and overworked Loneliness and burnout among young people in South Korea are not new. Advertisement An estimated 3.1% of Koreans aged between 19 and 39 are "reclusive lonely young people," according to an April 2023 report issued by South Korea's Ministry of Gender Equality and Family and translated to English by CNN . According to the report, several factors are at play, including financial difficulties, mental health, family problems, and overall health, CNN reported. Those who are in full-time employment in Seoul may not experience the same isolation as those in other areas. Bloomberg reported in November that more than 98% of grade-A offices in the capital are occupied, suggesting that remote work is a thing of the past . Companies in South Korea also have a history of overworking their employees. In March 2023, the government attempted to increase its 52-hour workweek to 69 hours but was forced to reconsider plans after facing backlash from Millennials, Gen Z, and labor unions. Advertisement According to data published by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, South Korea was the most overworked country in Asia and the fifth-most overworked country worldwide in 2022.

The same thing occurred in China, according to data released earlier this month by the country’s civil affairs ministry . The upticks were slight: in South Korea, 193,657 couples wedded in 2023, a 1% increase from 2022 and the first increase since 2011; while in China, 7.68 million couples tied the knot by late 2023, up about 847,000 from late 2022, and the first increase since 2013. But while some people may have been hopeful that this apparent shift could turn the tide for each country’s demographic misfortunes, as they suffer from declining birth rates and aging populations , in reality, the data only reinforces a broader downtrend, analysts say. In South Korea, a government official said in a briefing that couples delaying nuptials due to the COVID-19 pandemic may have caused the rise in marriages in 2023. Meanwhile, independent Chinese demographer He Yafu pointed in a blog post to five reasons marriages have declined over the past decade—a declining youth population, more men than women among the marriage-aged cohort, the average age of first marriages being delayed, marriage costs growing too high, and more young people simply choosing not to get married as attitudes change—all of which persist, and one reason why they rose last year: “Many young people postponed marriage due to the impact of the epidemic from 2020 to 2022. As the epidemic gradually ends, the wedding economy has rebounded significantly.” Stuart Gietel-Basten, professor of social science and public policy at Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, tells TIME that marriage still looks to be on a downward trend in Asia. “What we’ve actually seen is kind of a constant decline, but then that decline was accelerated during COVID,” he says. “It’s not as if there’s been some miracle in policy, or that there’s a big new change that supported couples to get married, or that they’ve put something in the water.” The governments of South Korea and China, as well as of neighboring countries facing similar demographic issues such as Japan, have been trying to encourage marriages in a bid to lift birth rates and counter the effects of a rapidly aging population. Last year, one region in China offered a reward of 1,000 yuan ($138) for newlywed heterosexual couples if the bride was under 25, in a bid to promote "age-appropriate marriage and childbearing.” In South Korea, which has the lowest birth rate in the world and a population expected to halve by 2100 , successive governments have spent some 380 trillion Korean won ($283 billion) over the last 20 years to try to respond to the nation’s aging society and boost fertility rates. Read More: China Is Desperate to Boost Its Low Birth Rates. It May Have to Accept the New Normal Gietel-Basten says that “in an arithmetical way,” increasing the number of marriages will also increase the birth rates, assuming married women are more likely to have children than unmarried women. But, “to a degree, this slightly misses the point,” he adds, explaining that a simultaneous trend of women having fewer children, on top of a significant number not having any at all, means that the birth rate will still decline. Demographers have long attributed the decline of marriage to the lack of appeal of the associated costs surrounding marriage. “It's not just a rejection of marriage. It's not that people don’t want to get married at all,” says Gietel-Basten, “but it’s a rejection of what we call that marriage package.” That includes, he says, social expectations around caring for in-laws, the freedom and autonomy women are expected to give up, and the high costs of child-rearing. As a result, some people are not marrying altogether, as the decadelong data show, while many are putting off getting married until they’re older. China’s historical census data shows the average age at first marriage in 2010 was 25.75 years old for men and 24 for women. In 2020, that rose to 29.38 years old for men and 27.95 for women. In South Korea, the average marrying age of a man in 2023 was 34 and for a woman was 31.5—compared to 10 years ago, when the average age was 32.2 and 29.6, respectively. Zheng Mu, assistant professor in the sociology and anthropology department at the National University of Singapore, tells TIME that policymakers have to go beyond simply pushing for more marriages and need to consider the wider, related issues instead. “I think they are still just scratching the surface in comparison to how fundamental, how deep this issue is,” she says. “Until you make people feel really at ease to pursue their life in a relatively autonomous way, I don’t think it would be effective.” Gietel-Basten argues that instead of trying to undo the effects of a demographic shift, governments must learn to adapt. “We’ve got to stop trying to reverse it. Because it’s very difficult, if not impossible to reverse. This is just the way it is.” More Must-Reads From TIME The 100 Most Influential People of 2024 The Revolution of Yulia Navalnaya 6 Compliments That Land Every Time What's the Deal With the Bitcoin Halving?

The ruling conservative People Power Party took home 108 seats, becoming an even smaller minority than it is now. Voter turnout reached 67%, the highest in 32 years for a parliamentary election, according to the National Election Commission. State of the World from NPR Why are young men and women in South Korea drifting apart politically? The outcome is largely interpreted as a judgment on President Yoon, whose approval ratings have stayed below 40% for most of his two years in office. Public sentiment toward the president and the ruling party has especially soured in the months leading up to the elections amid soaring food prices and a prolonged medical crisis. Prices of some agricultural products nearly doubled in March, with general consumer prices rising over 3% compared to a year before. Major hospitals have been in an emergency mode since late February as young doctors left jobs over the government's plan to increase medical school enrollment. Yoon's critics and the opposition party have also attacked Yoon over scandals involving his family and accused him of eroding freedom of expression. President Yoon said of the election results on Thursday that he will "humbly accept the will of the people" and reform his administration, according to his chief of staff, Lee Kwan-seop. Yoon's senior aides, including Lee and Prime Minister Han Duck-soo offered to resign to take responsibility for the outcomes. Asia A luxury Dior handbag rattles South Korea's politics The ruling PPP's interim chief Han Dong-hoon also stepped down, admitting that his party failed to win people's minds. The PPP managed to dodge its worst-case scenario, however, with the left-of-center opposition bloc grabbing about a dozen seats short of the two-thirds supermajority, which would have allowed it to override the president's veto power and single-handedly impeach the president or hold a referendum to amend the constitution. But President Yoon is still expected to lose momentum to pursue some key policies, such as the medical reform and abolishment of the gender equality ministry. He will likely be pressured by the public and his party to seek cooperation with the DP leader Lee Jae-myung, whom he defeated in the 2022 presidential race by a razor-thin margin. Yoon has refused to sit down for a one-on-one talk with Lee. The election outcomes can also restrict Yoon's foreign policy agendas, such as strengthening ties with Japan. Yoon's resolution for the thorny issue of forced labor during colonial rule, which is credited for thawing the two governments' relationship, was deeply unpopular at home. He may no longer be able to push ahead with such initiatives. The new parliament starts its four-year term at the end of May.

Jung Yeon-je—AFP/Getty Images By Chad de Guzman April 3, 2024 1:45 AM EDT S outh Korea—the world’s poster child for demographic decline —has spent some $280 billion over the past 18 years to address its diminishing birth rate, which recently dropped to a new record-low of 0.72 babies per woman in a lifetime. It’s a result of a confluence of factors but mostly comes down to young Koreans’ frustrations with high costs of living and low quality of life . But while cash handouts have been the government’s go-to approach, experts say that just throwing money at the problem isn’t necessarily the best solution. Since April 2022, South Korea’s government has handed out vouchers worth 2 million won (around $1,500) to parents who produce their first child, with another 3 million won dispensed for every additional child. In an effort to further subsidize the cost of childbearing and childrearing, the government has continued to increase its budget for family cash assistance. The monthly stipend parents receive for a newborn’s first year also increased in 2024 to a million won (around $740) from 700,000 in 2023. And since 2018, parents receive a 100,000 won ($74) handout every month for each child’s first several years. For a child born in 2024, parents are expected to receive—over eight years—at least 29.6 million won, or about $22,000, from the government. Private companies have joined in on the campaign to boost birth rates via cash incentives, with some offering thousands of dollars for employees who reproduce—incentivized themselves by tax benefits and other government support measures for such programs. “It’s just so much simpler to go to the cash incentive, to use that policy tool,” Jisoo Hwang, associate professor of Economics at Seoul National University, tells TIME. “I think for any government, that has been the easier way to address the low fertility problem.” But Hwang and other analysts tell TIME that while handouts help, a better approach would be to focus on policies and programs that would address and improve broader quality-of-life issues. Such measures would bring their own unrelated benefits as well as indirectly help foster an environment where young people feel more inclined to have and raise children. Hwang says policymakers should consider redirecting funds from handouts for individuals to the improvement of social services that benefit a larger collective of people. “It may be actually more efficient to, instead of giving out small increments of cash subsidies, if we can actually invest in public education or public childcare, and to enhance the quality and accessibility of that throughout the country,” she tells TIME. To be sure, Seoul is making some moves along these lines to try to address quality-of-life problems. Last week, the government eased the burden on new parents seeking housing , with households that have children aged 2 or younger made eligible to special housing subscription systems in which the government allocates presale apartments through a raffle—a system that is considered the most cost-friendly way to purchase a house in South Korea, given high costs of real estate, especially in metropolitan areas . And earlier this year, President Yoon Suk-yeol announced that publicly funded after-school care programs for children would be expanded nationwide. Also last week, Yoon oversaw the launch of a high-speed train that would reduce travel time between Seoul and its outskirts to less than a quarter of the original commute. Land Minister Park Sang-woo told Reuters that the new train was viewed as another tool that might improve birth rates: “With two-hour commute on the way home, for example, how can anyone make time for babies? The idea is to give people more leisure time after work.” Hwang says the Yoon government’s non-cash-based approaches to tackling cost-of-living and quality-of-life issues for families indicate that it is taking the matter of declining birth rates seriously. But there’s a limit to how much any administration will prioritize long-term solutions—more fundamental changes to labor markets and education systems—whose results won’t likely be seen until they’re out of power. At the same time, however, policymakers neeed to be wary of introducing non-cash solutions that could create new problems, says Stuart Gietel-Basten, a demographer and professor of social science and public policy at Hong Kong University of Science and Technology. For example, he says, if the new high-speed train makes commuting easier, companies may just expect workers to do more work in a culture where long hours on the job are already pervasive. There’s also likely a limit to how much any of these programs can actually achieve. Demographers have previously warned that once fertility rates fall beneath a certain threshold , lifting them becomes extremely difficult because of self-reinforcing economic and social mechanisms. In the case of South Korea, authorities optimistically forecast the fertility rate will continue to decline, at least for the next two years before a projected slight uptick in 2026 that authorities believe will trend upward, albeit slightly, for the next decade. Yonhap reported in December that Lim Young-il, the head of the statistics office’s population trends division, attributes the current yearslong decline in South Korea’s birth rate, which he believes to be temporary, to the sharp decline in marriages at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. Across Asia, marriages have started to rebound . That’s not to say that continued investment in family-supporting programs is a waste. “By improving access to childcare, improving access to kindergartens, maternity leave, paternity leave, and so on and so forth, that has made people’s lives better,” Gietel-Basten tells TIME. “It may not necessarily have increased fertility. Maybe it will in time. But that’s not the [only] reason to bring in these kinds of policies.” More Must-Reads From TIME The 100 Most Influential People of 2024 The Revolution of Yulia Navalnaya 6 Compliments That Land Every Time What's the Deal With the Bitcoin Halving?

Kim Jae-Hwan—SOPA Images/LightRocket/Getty Images By Jenny Lee and Soo-Hyang Choi / Bloomberg March 19, 2024 2:15 AM EDT S outh Korean authorities have issued notices to temporarily suspend the licenses of two doctors in its first punishment since trainee doctors walked off their jobs about a month ago in protest of a government plan to increase medical school enrollment. Two senior members of the Korean Medical Association received a three-month license suspension notice that takes effect from April 15, the group said Tuesday, adding the doctors are being accused of instigating collective action despite the government order not to do so. Read More: Thousands of Striking Doctors in South Korea Defy Government’s Return-to-Work Deadline “We will immediately file a lawsuit because we cannot accept this matter,” Joo Sooho, a KMA spokesperson said in a telephone interview. KMA represents about 15,000 doctors, including trainees. The latest punishment comes as the prolonged walkout has been putting a strain on the medical system . Medical school professors, who also dispense health care, have said they would join the labor action and resign if the government does not take steps to resolve the standoff. Thousands of trainee doctors, who play key roles in providing emergency care and surgeries, walked off the job in late February to protest a government plan to increase enrollment at medical schools by 2,000 spots a year from the current 3,058. President Yoon Suk Yeol has shown no signs of backing down from the plan , saying it is essential to fix a doctor shortage that ranks among the most acute in the developed world. The South Korean government contends the enrollment plan is essential for providing care in the rapidly aging nation, and that medical seat numbers have not increased for nearly three decades. Doctors leading the protest say the plan won’t fix fundamental problems such as a dearth of physicians in vital fields, a concentration of doctors in urban areas and an array of legal risks. South Korean doctors rank among the best paid among Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries in comparison to average wages, which has led to criticism the labor action may be more about protecting the earning power of physicians rather than improving the health-care system.

Advertisement North Korea has been ramping up its testing of weapons and important related systems, working through a "to-do list," a US official said, and it's causing some alarm among the US and its allies. And with Russia becoming a closer partner, North Korea could be getting the help it needs to fill critical gaps in the development of key technologies, such as underwater drones and satellites. "They have been doing a lot of weapons demonstrations," said US State Department Deputy Assistant Secretary Jung H. Pak at a Monday event at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. "They've also, since January of 2021, said that they're going to do a whole series of tests and develop new technologies." Of those, Pak referred to hypersonic systems, unmanned underwater vessels, solid-fuel intercontinental ballistic missiles, and reconnaissance satellites. North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un publicly vowed in 2021 to work to introduce these weapons to counter what he called growing US hostility in the region. Advertisement "They had a list, they had a to-do list, and they've been developing and testing those capabilities," Pak said. The ramp-up in testing has probably been best demonstrated by its ballistic missile tests. In 2021, North Korea tested just eight missiles; in 2023, it tested 33. Missile testing frequently occurs in response to perceived provocations, such as joint military exercises between the US and South Korea, but they aren't strictly reactions. On Monday, North Korea launched multiple short-range ballistic missiles into its eastern waters, South Korea reported. Related story And on Wednesday, state media said North Korea had successfully tested a solid-fuel engine for a new intermediate-range hypersonic missile, adding that Kim viewed the strategic value of the new missile as being able to target US territory and that "enemies know better about it." Advertisement This week's tests were the first in over a month, coming on the heels of a major, 11-day joint US-South Korea military drill. Throughout the exercise, North Korea also conducted its own exercises, with various tank, artillery, and paratrooper operations. While it remains unclear how successful weapons testing has been for North Korea, the prioritization has given US officials pause. After Monday's test, a State Department spokesperson called on North Korea to "refrain from further provocative, destabilizing actions and return to diplomacy," a common response. At the CSIS panel, Pak echoed similar sentiments. "We're incredibly concerned about all of these developments," she said, but she noted that there isn't clear evidence indicating the potential for a near-term attack. She said that didn't seem in Kim's best interest. "But of course, we're always watchful of anything that, the gray zone activities," she added. Advertisement North Korea's ties to Russia The US has slapped North Korea with more sanctions in recent years in reaction to its testing, including some imposed in October 2022, as well as sanctions related to its weapons transfers to Russia to stopgap ammunition supplies. That closer relationship between Russia and North Korea, identified since Kim and Russian President Vladimir Putin met last September to discuss an arms deal , has also raised concerns for US officials, who worry about what potential technologies and capabilities Russia could offer Kim in exchange for ammo for the war in Ukraine. "North Korea certainly is not doing this for free," Pak said. "They're almost certainly looking for things like fighter aircraft, surface-to-air missiles, ballistic missile technologies, and other technologies or armored vehicles," she said, adding that there was a lot Russia could provide. There are many ways North Korea could benefit from this arrangement. It also gets to see how some of its weapons perform in combat, including its ballistic missiles, and that information could prove invaluable.

Karina and actor Lee Jae-wook rocked the K-pop world when they went public with their relationship in February, with some angry fans accusing her of "betrayal". Lee's agency C-JeS Studio confirmed the break up, saying he wanted to "focus on his filming projects". They added that the duo would "continue to support each other as colleagues". The backlash - which also saw Karina criticised for being an irresponsible frontwoman of her four-woman group, aespa - prompted her to issue an apology on Instagram, where she vowed "to heal the wounds" she had inflicted. "I apologise for surprising you greatly," wrote the singer, whose real name is Yu Ji-min. She pledged to show fans a "more mature and hardworking side" in future. Some fans drove a "protest truck" to her management agency when the news broke. "Is the love given to you by your fans not enough?" blared an electronic billboard on the vehicle. How jealous K-pop super fans try to dictate their idols' private lives K-pop star apologises after relationship goes public aespa, which debuted in 2020 with the single Black Mamba, is expected to release a new full-length album this quarter. Lee, 25, gained prominence after starring in the hit fantasy period drama Alchemy of Souls. He also stars in the Disney+ original series Royal Roader which was released in February. Karina's apology and now, breakup, offer a glimpse into the world of South Korea entertainment's "super fans", who are increasingly trying to dictate their idols' private lives. Theirs is not an isolated incident. Days before, South Korean actors Han So-hee and Ryu Jun-yeol had also announced that they have separated - just two weeks after publicly acknowledging their relationship. The couple parted ways following a backlash from fans, who accused them of being in a "transit relationship", noting that Ryu had recently ended a seven-year romance with his Reply 1988 co-star singer-actress Lee Hyeri. Han, who most recently starred in the Netflix period thriller Gyeongseong Creature, took to Instagram last Friday with a lengthy and emotional message disputing the allegations. "Any more of these groundless speculations and it will really wear me out," she wrote in the post, which has since been deleted. After the split, Han's agency 9ATO Entertainment said: "The two both found their roles as actors to be more important. They promised to no longer be emotionally exhausted with their personal life." Last October, Blackpink singer Jisoo and actor Ahn Bo-hyun ended their relationship just two months after they said they were dating.

The bugs, which affect about 91,000 devices worldwide, could allow a bad actor to gain a number of invasive privileges, including the ability to get root access to an impacted device. Researchers write that the bugs—which impact WebOS versions 4 through 7—could hypothetically allow a hacker to add a new user to the device, inject their own code into it, and thus “fully take over” the TV. Bitdefender originally alerted LG to these issues in November. Gizmodo reached out to LG for comment and will update this story if it responds.

You could also wind up getting your device tied into a crypto-mining scheme or a botnet.

A majority of the impacted devices are located in South Korea and Hong Kong, as well as in Sweden.

LG released a patch for the security issues as part of its latest update on March 22. Most LG devices should have downloaded this update automatically.

Advertisement The NATO military alliance should consider broadening its membership to include Asia-Pacific nations like Japan and New Zealand, said a former NATO supreme allied commander. "NATO should think about recruiting a few new members from outside its traditional boundaries," retired US Navy Adm. James Stavridis wrote in a Bloomberg op-ed on Monday. Stavridis served as the military alliance's chief from 2009 to 2013. Before that, he was the Commander of the US Southern Command from 2006 to 2009, where he oversaw military operations in Latin America.

Widening NATO's membership, Stavridis wrote, was a necessary response to the ongoing conflicts in the Middle East , the Russia-Ukraine war , US-China tensions , and the territorial dispute in the South China Sea . Advertisement In his op-ed, Stavridis suggested recruiting Asia-Pacific countries "that share the alliance's vision of freedom, democracy, liberty and human rights." That list of potential allies includes nations like Australia, Japan, New Zealand, and South Korea. In addition, Southeast Asian countries like the Philippines, Thailand, and Singapore could also be brought in due to their ties with the US, Stavridis wrote. That said, Stavridis did acknowledge the difficulties of "expanding NATO geographically to include a group of Asian democracies." Related story Besides managing the "cultural, linguistic, and geographic differences," Stavridis noted that a larger membership would make it "even harder to gain broad consensus on any given mission." Advertisement "I'd say the challenges and the benefits feel roughly balanced, but given the practical and political hurdles, it is probably too soon to consider a global NATO," Stavridis wrote. "But perhaps there is a middle path, which might entail more formalized relationships between the alliance and the Asian democracies," he added, suggesting arrangements like "clearly articulated security guarantees" and "joint procurement of advanced weapon systems." To be sure, NATO has already been expanding its outreach efforts to Asia. Since 2022, Japan and South Korea have attended the military alliance's annual summits. Last year, NATO reportedly considered setting up a liaison office in Japan . Plans, however, fell through following opposition from French President Emmanuel Macron . Advertisement The military alliance's overtures to Asia appear to have drawn the ire of countries like China, whose defense ministry has accused NATO of being a " walking war machine. " "In recent years, NATO has been inching closer to the Asia Pacific and using the nonexistent 'China threat' as an excuse to advance bloc confrontation, which poses a threat to regional security," China's defense ministry spokesperson Wu Qian said of NATO during a press conference in January. When approached for comment, a NATO official told BI that the alliance isn't planning to bring in any new members from Asia. "There are no plans to expand NATO beyond the North Atlantic area, but the Alliance is deepening its ties with its Indo-Pacific partners, including on technology, cyber, and hybrid threats as well as support to Ukraine," the NATO representative told BI.

North Korea fired a ballistic missile on March 18, Seoul's military said, as US Secretary of State Antony Blinken visited South Korea to meet top officials and attend a democracy summit. Anthony Wallace–AFP/Getty Images By Anna Gordon March 18, 2024 12:56 PM EDT N orth Korea launched ballistic missiles early Monday morning local time, marking the first such test in about a month. The missiles flew approximately 200 miles from Pyongyang and landed in the waters off of North Korea’s east coast between the Korean peninsula and Japan, according to South Korean officials. The Japanese prime minister Fumio Kishida said that no damage was reported but nevertheless condemned the missile launching. “North Korea’s series of actions threaten the peace and security of our region and the international community, and are absolutely unacceptable,” he said during a parliamentary session, per the Associated Press . The U.S. secretary of state Antony Blinken was in Seoul when the missiles were launched, along with high profile representatives from several other countries who were attending the Summit for Democracy conference . The annual summit was created by the Biden Administration in 2021 to address the threats to the democratic process worldwide. This year’s summit focused on threats from technology including deepfakes, generative artificial intelligence, and misinformation. The U.S. The State Department condemned the launches saying that they were a threat to the security of the region and reaffirmed its commitment to protect South Korea and Japan from the North Korean threat. Last week, the U.S. and South Korean militaries completed a series of joint military drills, which the North views as a rehearsal for an invasion . Currently, 80,000 U.S. troops are stationed in South Korea. North Korea has increased the frequency of its ballistic missile tests in the last few years, testing 33 missiles in the year 2023 alone according to the Center for Arms Control and Non-Proliferation. In 2021, for comparison, it tested just eight missiles . North Korea typically frames the launches as a response to escalating military activity by the U.S. and South Korea. Bernard Loo, senior fellow at the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies in Singapore, told TIME last year that by launching missiles, North Korea is trying to get international attention since “it has absolutely no leverage whatsoever, except when it comes to nuclear and ballistic missiles tests.” Nevertheless, the behavior remains concerning to leaders around the world, since nuclear weapons are highly dangerous and could pose a threat to the entire planet if launched.

Here’s how it works . Wearables Samsung Galaxy Ring could tell you what to have for dinner News By Steven Shaw published 20 March 2024 What’s on the menu, Samsung? Comments (0) (Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central) What you need to know Samsung Galaxy Ring may offer customized diet advice for users. The Ring is rumored to integrate with Samsung Food to offer a meal planning service. Meal recommendations could be based on the health information collected by the Galaxy Ring. The Samsung Galaxy Ring is Samsung’s first foray into the smart ring market. And, after providing a close-up look at the Galaxy Ring at MWC , expectations are high for when it finally arrives later in 2024. Now, it looks as though the Galaxy Ring will provide diet and nutrition advice that could put it ahead of its competitors in this growing sector. A report from the Korean publication Chosun Biz (via Android Authority ) suggests that the Galaxy Ring will work in tandem with Samsung Food to provide wearers with customized diet advice. This includes “optimized recipes and diets based on information such as calorie consumption and body mass index”. Samsung Food was launched back in 2019 and is currently available in 8 languages across 104 countries. The AI-driven service provides users with thousands of recipes and can amend those recipes to suit individual dietary requirements. It can also analyze the contents of a Galaxy Ring user’s fridge to make meal recommendations. It could (in theory) send the recipe to their smart Samsung oven, which could automatically set the cooking time and temperature as required. (Image credit: Samsung) The report goes on to suggest that the Galaxy Ring and Samsung Food could go one step further by integrating with Samsung’s e-food food delivery service (currently only available in South Korea), which could help users order any missing ingredients. Chosun Biz quotes an anonymous commentator who says that by doing this, “Samsung Electronics will be able to link and expand the food delivery business to the world.” This wouldn’t be the first time Samsung has tried to create this type of service. Samsung has been trying a food recommendation service based on data from some Galaxy Watch wearers in South Korea, so the software evidently already exists for this. Whether it would persuade Galaxy Ring wearers to switch all their Samsung appliances is another question, however. The Galaxy Ring is expected to be released in the summer , with an official unveiling at July’s Unpacked event highly anticipated.

Here’s how it works . Apps & Software Some Samsung devices are already getting the April update with camera improvements News By Brady Snyder published 28 March 2024 Instant Slow-Mo now works with 480p resolution videos. Comments (0) (Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central) What you need to know Samsung's April 2024 update is starting to reach some Galaxy S24 devices with security fixes and other improvements. While the update brings support for 480p resolution Instant Slow-Mo videos, other camera improvements are unclear. The monthly security patch is arriving ahead of schedule and comes in at a size of 818MB. Samsung's monthly security update is reaching some Galaxy S24 devices already in the U.S., following early rollouts in other regions. The April 2024 update became available on a few of Android Central's devices starting Wednesday, March 27, bringing security patches and bug fixes. While not explicitly stated in Samsung's changelog, the April 2024 update could fix some of the Galaxy S24 series' persistent camera issues. The update comes in at 818MB, but not much is revealed by the official changelog. Samsung only provides vague references to improved stability, reliability, and security coming with the April 2024 patch. (Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central) This differs from other regions, like South Korea, where Samsung specifically outlined camera improvements that were included in the April 2024 update. In a post on Samsung's community forums, a user shared the changelog for the April 2024 update in South Korea on a Galaxy S24 ultra smartphone. These fixes include better white balance and exposure, low-light photography, color accuracy, text clarity, and support for 480p resolution in Instant Slow-Mo video. Some of these improvements, such as color accuracy and text clarity, specifically apply to the ExpertRAW camera app. Android Central confirmed that the U.S. version of the April 2024 update does indeed bring Instant Slow-Mo support to videos with a 480x480 resolution. This does not necessarily confirm that all the other camera improvements are also available in the April 2024 update in the States. However, it means at least one of them was included in the update but not the changelog. To check if your Samsung Galaxy S24 smartphone has received the over-the-air April 2024 security patch, open the settings app and navigate to the software update page. If it appears, start downloading the update — which can range from about 600MB to 900MB, depending on your region.

South Korea’s Doctors Strike Weighs on Yoon’s Party Ahead of Elections | TIME TIME Logo Sign Up for Our Entertainment Newsletter Subscribe Subscribe Sections Home U.S. Politics World Health Climate Future of Work by Charter Business Tech Entertainment Ideas Science History Sports Magazine TIME 2030 Next Generation Leaders TIME100 Leadership Series TIME Studios Video TIME100 Talks TIMEPieces The TIME Vault TIME for Health TIME for Kids TIME Edge TIME CO2 Red Border: Branded Content by TIME Coupons Personal Finance by TIME Stamped Shopping by TIME Stamped Join Us Newsletters Subscribe Give a Gift Shop the TIME Store TIME Cover Store Customer Care US & Canada Global Help Center Reach Out Careers Press Room Contact the Editors Media Kit Reprints and Permissions More About Us Privacy Policy Your Privacy Rights Terms of Use Modern Slavery Statement Site Map Connect with Us Presented By World South Korea South Korean President Stands Firm as Doctors Strike Weighs on His Party Ahead of Elections South Korean President Stands Firm as Doctors Strike Weighs on His Party Ahead of Elections 4 minute read People at the Seoul Railway Station watch a broadcast of South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol addressing the nation on April 1, 2024. Ahn Young-joon—AP By Hyung-jin Kim / AP April 1, 2024 2:45 AM EDT SEOUL — South Korea’s President vowed Monday not to back down in the face of vehement protests by doctors seeking to derail his plan to drastically increase medical school admissions, as he called their walkouts “an illegal collective action” that poses “a grave threat to our society.” About 12,000 medical interns and residents in South Korea have been on strike for six weeks , causing hundreds of canceled surgeries and other treatments at university hospitals. In support of their action, many senior doctors at their teaching schools have also submitted resignations though they haven’t stopped treating patients. Officials say they want to raise the yearly medical school cap by 2,000 from the current 3,058 to create more doctors to deal with the country’s rapidly aging population. Doctors counter that schools can’t handle such an abrupt increase in students and that it would eventually hurt the country’s medical services. But critics say doctors, one of the best-paid professions in South Korea, are simply worried that the supply of more doctors would result in lower future incomes. Public surveys show that a majority of South Koreans support the government’s push to create more doctors. But observers say many people are increasingly fed up with the protracted confrontation between the government and doctors, threatening to deal a blow to governing party candidates ahead of next week’s parliamentary elections. Read More: The Ultimate Election Year: Half of World Heads to Polls in 2024 In a nationally televised address, President Yoon Suk Yeol said adding 2,000 medical students is the minimum increase needed to address a shortage of physicians in rural areas, the military and essential but low-paying professions like pediatrics and emergency departments. Yoon said South Korea’s doctor-to-patient ratio—2.1 physicians per 1,000 people—is far below the average of 3.7 in the developed world. “Increasing the number of doctors is a state project that we can’t further delay,” Yoon said. Yoon urged the striking doctors to return to work , saying they have a responsibility to protect people’s lives in line with the local medical law. He also said the government remains open to talks if doctors come up with a unified proposal that adequately explains why adding 2,000 more students is too steep of an increase. “I can’t tolerate an attempt to carry through their thoughts by force without due logic and grounds,” Yoon said. “The illegal collective action by some doctors has become a grave threat to our society.” Yoon said the recruitment plan won’t lead to lower earnings for doctors, citing what he called expected increases in national income and demand for medical services in the fast-aging society. He said the average income of South Korean doctors is the highest in the developed world. Yoon’s speech is expected to draw an angry response from doctors, who have maintained they can have serious talks only when the government drops its increased enrollment plan. They deny opposing the plan over worries about future incomes. Yoon said the government is taking final administrative steps to suspend the licenses of the strikers but added he doesn’t want to punish the young doctors. This implies that his government is willing to soften punitive measures on the strikers if they return to work soon. Read More: Thousands of Striking Doctors in South Korea Defy Government’s Return-to-Work Deadline Yoon recently ordered officials to pursue “a flexible measure” to resolve the dispute and seek constructive consultations with doctors at the request of ruling party leader Han Dong-hoon. The striking junior doctors represent a fraction of the total doctors in South Korea—estimated at 115,000 by Yoon and 140,000 by a doctors’ association. But in some major hospitals, they account for about 30% to 40% of doctors, assisting qualified doctors and department chiefs during surgeries and other treatments while training. Doctors say the government enrollment plan lacks measures to resolve key medical issues such as how to increase the number of physicians in some key but unpopular professions. They say newly recruited students would also try to work in the capital region and in high-paying fields like plastic surgery and dermatology. They say the government plan would also likely result in doctors performing unnecessary treatments due to increased competition.

Chung Sung-Jun—Getty Images By HYUNG-JIN KIM / AP Updated: April 10, 2024 9:52 PM EDT | Originally published: April 10, 2024 7:52 AM EDT SEOUL, South Korea — South Korea’s liberal opposition parties appeared set to win a landslide victory in Wednesday’s parliamentary election, vote counts showed, a result that could make conservative President Yoon Suk Yeol a lame duck for his remaining three years in office. With most of the votes cast counted, the main opposition Democratic Party and its satellite party appear to have won a combined 175 seats in the 300-member National Assembly. Another small liberal opposition party was expected to win 12 seats under a proportional representation system, according to South Korean media tallies. Yoon’s ruling People Power Party and its satellite party were projected to have obtained 109 seats. The final official results were expected later Thursday. Read More: The Ultimate Election Year: All the Elections Around the World in 2024 But the outcome means the liberal opposition forces would extend their control of the parliament, though they will likely fail to garner the super majority of 200 seats that gives them legislative powers to pass bills vetoed by a president and even impeach him or her. Wednesday’s election was widely seen as a mid-term confidence vote on Yoon, a former top prosecutor who took office in 2022 for a single five-year term. He has pushed hard to boost cooperation with the U.S. and Japan as a way to address a mix of tough security and economic challenges. But Yoon has been grappling with low approval ratings at home and a liberal opposition-controlled parliament that has limited his major policy platforms. Regardless of the results, Yoon will stay in power and his major foreign policies will likely be unchanged. But the ruling party’s big election defeat could set back Yoon’s domestic agenda and leave him facing an intensifying political offensive by his liberal opponents. Read More: South Korea’s ‘Dior Bag Scandal,’ Explained Exit polls sponsored by South Korea’s major TV stations earlier predicted a bigger win by the opposition parties. “We did our best to do politics that follow public sentiments, but results of exit polls are disappointing,” ruling party Han Dong-hoon said in televised comments. “We’ll watch ballot counting to the end.” After gathering to watch TV broadcasts showing results of the exit polls, Democratic Party members cheered and clapped their hands. “We’ll humbly watch the people’s choices to the end. Thanks much!” party leader Lee Jae-myung told reporters. Of the 300 seats, 254 will be elected through direct votes in local districts, and the other 46 to the parties according to their proportion of the vote. The final voter turnout for South Korea’s 44 million eligible voters was tentatively estimated at 67%, the highest for a parliamentary election since 1992, according to the National Election Commission. Ahead of the election, the conservatives and their liberal rivals exchanged toxic rhetoric and mudslinging. Their mutual contempt deepened during the 2022 presidential election, during which Yoon and Lee, then the Democratic Party candidate, spent months demonizing each other. Yoon eventually beat Lee in the country’s most closely fought presidential contest. Lee is now a harsh critic of Yoon’s policies and is eyeing another presidential bid. His main potential conservative rival in the next presidential race is Han, an ally of Yoon who served as his justice minister. Lee faces an array of corruption investigations that he argues are politically motivated and pushed by by Yoon’s government. There was brief soul-searching about South Korea’s divisive politics after Lee was stabbed in the neck in January by a man who, according to police, tried to kill Lee to prevent him from becoming president. But as the parliamentary election approached, the rival parties began churning out abusive rhetoric and crude insults against each other. During the election campaigning, Han called Lee “a criminal” and labeled his past comments as “trash.” Lee’s party spokesperson described Han’s mouth as a “trash bin.” Han accused Lee of using a sexist remark against a female ruling party candidate. Read More: South Korean Opposition Leader, After Being Stabbed in Neck, Urges End to ‘Warlike Politics’ Chung Jin-young, a former dean of the Graduate School of Pan-Pacific International Studies at Kyung Hee University, predicted that the opposition parties could win a combined 150 to 180 seats. “That would cause a political deadlock for the Republic of Korea for the next three years, as both the ruling and opposition parties can’t pursue things unilaterally and won’t likely make terms with each other,” Chung said. Earlier this year, Yoon saw rising approval ratings over his strong push to drastically increase the number of medical students despite vehement protests by incumbent doctors. Yoon has said he aims to create more doctors to brace for the country’s rapidly aging population, but thousands of young doctors have gone on strike, saying that schools can’t handle an abrupt increase in students. Read More: Thousands of Striking Doctors in South Korea Defy Government’s Return-to-Work Deadline The doctors’ walkouts eventually left Yoon facing growing calls to find a compromise, with patients and others experiencing delays of surgeries and other inconveniences. Yoon’s ruling party has also been struggling with rising prices of agricultural products and other goods and criticism of Yoon’s personnel management style. “This election is an assessment of Yoon’s presidency. The stakes for him are whether he’s able to fully implement his liberal democratic agenda, which is his top priority,” Duyeon Kim, a senior analyst at the Washington-based Center for a New American Security, said. “He and his party have criticized the previous progressive party for democratic backsliding.” More Must-Reads From TIME The 100 Most Influential People of 2024 The Revolution of Yulia Navalnaya 6 Compliments That Land Every Time What's the Deal With the Bitcoin Halving?

Email Facebook X Whatsapp LinkedIn Telegram Telegram TL:DR Samsung launches iMac-like all-in-one desktop in South Korea. New PC features metal frame, ultra-slim design, and Intel Core Ultra processor. Priced at $1,469, available for pre-order, expected release on April 22. Samsung is ramping up its activity in the PC sector with its All-In-One desktop now launched in the company’s native South Korea. This product launch comes just a year after Samsung released its first desktop PC in years. Its first foray back into the world of PCs after some time away featured a 24-inch display with built-in speakers that support Dolby Atmos 3D. Its newest addition has a metal frame, an ultra-slim design (6.5mm), and an Intel Core Ultra processor. According to publisher Sammobile , an official from Samsung Electronics has said: “Samsung All-in-One Pro is an all-round PC that can be used in a variety of daily life such as studying, work, and hobbies with its sophisticated design and powerful performance. “It provides a more convenient and free daily life with powerful performance, a differentiated Galaxy ecosystem, and AI functions .” The PC is priced at 1.99 million (roughly $1,469) and is now available for pre-order, before being readily available from April 22 in South Korea. It’s not yet known if this will be launched worldwide or elsewhere. Features of Samsung’s All-In-One Pro PC The metal design runs throughout the products, including the mouse and wireless keyboard which are bundled with the new PC. Upgrades from the previous Samsung desktop release are apparent throughout, with this computer being bigger and better. It has a 27-inch 4K screen and like the former option is fitted with 3D loudspeakers that are compatible with Dolby Atmos audio. The Intel Core Ultra processor gives a higher CPU and GPU performance than the 13th Gen Intel Core i5 chip which was used in last year’s variant. It’s expected to come with at least 16GB RAM and 256GB SSD storage too. The keyboard has a dedicated Microsoft Copilot AI key with artificial intelligence being weaved in throughout this design. There’s a built-in webcam and the PC comes with Windows 11 Home and other Galaxy Ecosystem apps and features, including Buds Auto Switch, Multi Control, Quick Share and Second Screen. This means those with Galaxy phones or tablets can drag and drop files easily between the two, as well as link them up to see and reply to phone notifications on the desktop.

Email Facebook X Whatsapp LinkedIn Telegram Telegram Stealthmole secures $7m funding for its AI-powered dark web intelligence firm StealthMole, a rising dark web data intelligence startup , has announced that it secured $7 million in a Series A funding round. We’re incredibly excited to announce that StealthMole has just closed a US$7 million Series A funding round! A huge thank you to all our investors, partners, customers, and our incredible team for their unwavering support that has allowed us to reach this significant milestone.… — Fusion Intelligence Center @ StealthMole (@stealthmole_int) March 28, 2024 The Singapore-based outlet said in a blog post that funds will be channeled towards StealthMole’s expansion into new markets, and supporting its efforts to apply its technology to more commercial uses. The funding round was led by Korea Investment Partners (KIP), a multinational joint venture between RHL Ventures, Penjana Kapital, and KB Investment called Hibiscus Fund, as well as Smilegate Investment. The company says it traces criminals using 255 billion analyzed data points from the dark web, deep web, and various hidden sources while leveraging advanced AI . Through AI and machine learning, it reportedly collects and connects data from hidden digital sources. This, in turn, aids governments and law enforcement in early risk mitigation and criminal tracking and supports businesses in cyber incident response and prevention. StealthMole founder Louis Hur stated: “StealthMole came about from a critical market gap I encountered while working in cybersecurity and white-hat hacking: a severe lack of data points and information networks specifically within Asia.” He added that data leaks, anonymized transactions, and cybercrimes were on the rise, demanding a better understanding of digital threats. In response to the funding, managing director Kim Min-Q said: “As organizations across the world continue to digitize, cybercrimes will not only become more rampant but also more advanced. StealthMole has shown tremendous agility in this regard.” Who are StealthMole? Founded in 2022, the company is co-led by Simon Choi, an experienced threat investigator and former adjunct professor with extensive experience in working with South Korea’s national police and intelligence agencies, and Hur, a specialist in enterprise IT security who also founded a cybersecurity firm in South Korea. Startups in the cybersecurity sector are facing a daunting market environment, contending with decreased valuations and increasing pressure to sell while competing for vital funding and collaborations.

Volodymyr Zelenskyy, Ukraine's president, has warned with increased urgency that his country could lose the war if it doesn't get the $60 billion in US military aid that Republicans in Congress have refused to release. "Can we hold our ground? No," Zelenskyy recently told PBS of Ukraine's prospects should it not get the funding. Dmytro Kuleba, Ukraine's foreign minister, was just as blunt in a recent interview. Advertisement "Give us the damn Patriots," he told Politico in March, referring to the US-made air-defense systems Ukraine has used to defend itself from Russian missiles. On the front line in east and south Ukraine, reports say the situation is increasingly desperate, with Russia outfiring Ukraine at a rate of three to one . Senior Ukrainian military officials who spoke to Politico said Russia could break through wherever it focuses its anticipated summer offensive. Russia will likely be able to "penetrate the front line and to crash it in some parts," the military officials told the outlet. Advertisement "I would say the conditions now are probably more favorable for a Russian breakthrough than at any time since the opening stages of the war," Bryden Spurling, an analyst with the RAND Corporation, told Business Insider. Without aid from the US, it will become more difficult for Ukraine to defend its cities and critical infrastructure, such as power stations, from waves of Russian missile and drone attacks. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. AP Photo/Efrem Lukatsky Last year, Ukraine was able to shoot down about 90% of Russian attacks using Patriot air-defense systems, the Kyiv Post reported in May of last year, but that number has dropped to around 30% , Ukraine officials said last week. Ukraine is also having serious difficulties recruiting enough troops . It doesn't regularly release its military-casualty figures, but in the fall of last year, US officials estimated last fall that there had been up to 190,000 Ukrainian soldiers have been killed or wounded. Advertisement Russia suffered steep casualties early in the war, but it's been able to boost the size of its troops with incentives to those who enlist, a US State Department official said earlier this month. After suffering huge equipment losses early in the war, Russia started producing more ammunition, and its allies, including Iran and North Korea, have provided it with drones and rockets . Putin's strategy of waiting for Western support for the war to weaken and for Ukraine's crucial aid supplies to dwindle appears to be working. Without the US aid package, "the risk of a Russian breakthrough rises substantially," Spurling said. "Even at best, it limits Ukraine's options and ultimately leads to more Ukrainian lives and material lost," he added. Advertisement The role of the West George Barros, an analyst at the Institute for the Study of War, told BI that Ukraine is on a "starvation diet" and needs more aid. One US volunteer fighting for Ukraine previously told BI's Sinéad Baker he thought Ukraine lost Avdiivka, a city in the Donetsk Oblast, because its army lacked sufficient ammunition. Western equipment, like tanks, were sent mostly in "symbolic" amounts, Barros said. This limited support doesn't just weaken Ukraine's volume of fire — it can torpedo its whole approach to battle planning. Advertisement "It forces them to operate differently, be extremely conservative, not have the comfort to be able to take acceptable losses," he added. The US's monthslong delay in sending ATACMS ballistic missiles to Ukraine ahead of its counteroffensive last year was a case in point. Barros said it was "really painful to watch" Ukraine start attacking the southern region of Zaporizhzhia without them because ATACMS could have taken out an air base in Berdyansk being used by Russian helicopters. Related story Instead, Western-supplied German Leopard tanks that attempted to advance in the counteroffensive were "shredded" by rival helicopters, he said. Advertisement Ukrainian soldiers work on the tank gun of a Leopard 1 A5 main battle tank. Klaus-Dietmar Gabbert/picture alliance via Getty Images "From a campaign-design perspective, it's very frustrating because ideally, the Ukrainians should have had the capability to strike that Russian attack-helicopter base on day zero," Barros added. It was the first thing Ukraine took out when ATACMS finally arrived. Those battlefield frustrations have made an already difficult political situation back in the US worse. Barros said there are "bad-faith debaters and policymakers" who "point to a failed Ukrainian summer 2023 counteroffensive and then say, 'Look at all this money we've given Ukraine. Look at all the stuff we've given Ukraine.' But they don't bother to actually take in the facts of the matter." Advertisement Justin Bronk, an air power expert at London's Royal United Services Institute, told BI that overhyping the impact any Western weapon system could have on Ukraine's military prospects has led to "a very dysfunctional discussion." He said that kind of thinking can lead to "unrealistic expectations" for both Ukraine and its Western partners. NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg has talked about the possibility of creating a NATO-led five-year, $100 billion fund for Ukraine, a move designed to give the US less individual sway over the country's fate. More reliable, long-term aid could provide a major boost to Ukraine's military. NATO leaders hope to have details in place for a July summit in Washington, diplomats told Politico. Advertisement Russian military weaknesses could hamper its advances Ukraine is desperately trying to shore up its defenses ahead of an anticipated Russian attack this summer. It's constructing thousands of miles of multilayered defense lines to protect its territory, much like Russia did last year. But Mykola Bielieskov, an advisor to Ukraine's military leadership at the National Institute for Strategic Studies in Kyiv, told iPaper that such lines have to be defended by artillery fire to be effective — and that's what Ukraine's running short on. "In-depth defense reinforced with obstacles only works if buttressed with proper firepower," he said. Advertisement However, Ukraine continues to achieve some successes despite being outgunned and outmanned by Russia. Ukraine's long-range drone strikes are seriously affecting Russia's oil and gas sector , which Russia relies on to fund its military campaign. Ukraine's innovative, inexpensive sea drones have also hurt Russia's Black Sea Fleet , helping keep a crucial maritime corridor open for Ukraine's grain exports. A Ukrainian drone operator from the 24th separate mechanized brigade driving a drone on August 8. Anadolu/Getty Images Analysts also say that Russia's military has weaknesses that are preventing the Kremlin from taking full advantage of the situation. Despite Ukraine's woes, Russia has so far only been able to make incremental gains this year, such as seizing control of Avdiivka in February. Russia has faced serious problems within its ranks, including inept officers, an excessively rigid command structure, and low morale among troops who are often thrown into high-casualty, head-on assaults on Ukrainian positions. Advertisement Spurling said Russia's failure to establish dominance of the air and the fact that Ukraine destroyed a number of its armored vehicles could also have hampered a planned offensive. "These things will make it harder for Russia to exploit any breach in the Ukrainian lines," he said. What would Ukraine's defeat look like? But if no more US aid is coming and Ukraine's European allies fail to boost supplies to make up for the shortfall, Ukraine will likely face defeat. What that might look like, though, is unclear. George Beebe, a former director of the CIA's Russia Analysis Unit, told BI that Russia doesn't have the resources or the desire to seize all of Ukraine. Advertisement "Russia could not conquer all of Ukraine without mustering an invasion force many times the size of its present army, and occupying and governing that territory would be enormously bloody and expensive for Russia. The odds that it would attempt to do so are therefore miniscule," he said. He added that Russia would likely seize more territory east of the Dnipro River that it sees as rightfully Russian and create a "no-man's-land," with heavy fortifications separating the parts of Ukraine it's seized from the rest of the country. Despite the setbacks, Ukraine continues to resist Russia's attacks. Spurling said the country has defied predictions so far. "For Ukraine to suffer total defeat, we'd need to see a major collapse in Ukrainian lines and morale," he said. "Given Ukraine's ongoing resilience and the challenges Russia's own military is facing, I think it's a low risk. But it's not zero."

Terraform Labs and its founder Do Kwon have been found liable on civil fraud charges on Friday by a jury in Manhattan. The jury agreed with the SEC that the two misled investors before their stablecoin's 2022 collapse shocked crypto markets around the world. Reuters reports: The SEC accused the company and Kwon of misleading investors in 2021 about the stability of TerraUSD, a stablecoin designed to maintain a value of $1. The regulator also accused them of falsely claiming Terraform's blockchain was used in a popular Korean mobile payment app. SEC attorney Laura Meehan said during closing arguments that the platform's success story was "built on lies." "If you swing big and you miss, and you don't tell people that you came up short, that is fraud," Meehan said. Louis Pellegrino, an attorney for Terraform, told the jury on Friday the SEC's case relied on statements taken out of context and that Terraform and Kwon had been truthful about their products and how they worked, even when they failed. "Terraform is still out there, trying to rebuild and make purchasers whole," he said.

Apple is looking to hire a so-called "Briefing Experience Specialist" in all three countries. This is a sales position that will involve demonstrating the Vision Pro's capabilities to business/enterprise customers, according to the job listing. "You will design and deliver demonstrations that present the capabilities of the product and its revolutionary new technology," the job listing says. "You will also showcase solutions, representative use cases, and transformative user workflows that inspire customer investment in the technology, the visionOS platform, and the product itself." Apple posted the same job listing for the Vision Pro in the U.K. last year , but the headset remains available in the U.S. only following its February 2 launch . On its website, Apple says the Vision Pro will launch in more countries later this year, but the company has not provided a more specific timeframe, or indicated exactly where the headset will become available next. Last month, Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said he believed the Vision Pro would launch internationally before Apple's annual developers conference WWDC , which typically takes place in the first week of June. MacRumors contributor Aaron Perris recently obtained information that suggests Apple is preparing to expand the Vision Pro to Australia, Canada, China, France, Germany, Japan, Singapore, South Korea, and the U.K. at a minimum, and the "Briefing Experience Specialist" job listings have now been posted in at least four of those countries.

It has its flaws (weight, glare) but for me they are insignificant compared to the pluses. When you moving out of an immersive environment it starts coming back at your lap first so you can see things like a keyboard. 1. Travel to Zimbabwe, Machu Picchu, Foz do Iguaçu without leaving your chair using the share spatial app. It gives you 90% of the visual experience for those who can't actually go there. 2. Use a 6 foot monitor from your mac 3. Play lossless music from your AirPods Pro 2 with the album cover inches from your face. Much more enjoyable. 4. Run a "Mindfullness" or other mediation app to help relax and sleep. Take a snooze by a running creek in an Oregon winter scene. See the results of the mediation if you have an Apple Watch. 5. Watch a 3D concert where the singer swings her hair in your face with AmazeVR concerts, although it is a bit creepy. 6. Explore the constellations. Grab one out of the night sky to know more about it with SkyGuide 7. Checkout which flights are landing at an airport in 3D with their plane type, where they came from, etc. with testflight 8. Explore extinct creatures with David Attenborough. Watch them in 3D in their native environment. 9. Convert your old photos into 3D ones with Spacial Media Toolkit. Just a start but shows what can be done. 10. Explore the Mars lander in 3D. Grab a part and see what it does with Exploring Mars. 11. Travel to a museum for a close look at the Mona Lisa with Art Authority museum. Explore contemporary artists with Art Universe. 12. Not a gamer but occasionally play Legos in 3D or place parts on a music store 13. Movies, some in 3D, of course with Apple TV and Disney Plus. Much better than going to the theater. No fuzzy screen, better sound. And this is just the start. More great stuff is coming. Things to look for once VP is available in your market.

Announced today (Mar. 20) from the Biden-Harris Administration , the investment under the CHIPS and Science Act , as well as Intel’s already proposed funding over the next five years, marks one of the largest investments ever announced in U.S. semiconductor manufacturing. The CHIPS money is expected to include investments in Chandler in Arizona, Rio Rancho in New Mexico, New Albany in Ohio, and Hillsboro in Oregon. In the Government-issued statement the impact of this funding is said to “directly create over 10,000 manufacturing jobs and nearly 20,000 construction jobs.” The Under Secretary of Commerce for Standards and Technology and NIST Director Laurie E. Locascio says: “The innovation sparked by this proposed investment would strengthen America’s technological and research leadership and significantly help enhance our nation’s manufacturing capacity while strengthening communities and creating good-paying jobs.” Intel’s CEO Pat Gelsinger describes this deal as being a “defining moment” as “AI is supercharging the digital revolution and everything digital needs semiconductors . “CHIPS Act support will help to ensure that Intel and the U.S. stay at the forefront of the AI era as we build a resilient and sustainable semiconductor supply chain to power our nation’s future.” The semiconductor competition wages on There is fierce competition within the semiconductor industry as the likes of South Korea and the U.S. battle it out to become champions in the sector. Earlier in the year, in January, Counterpoint Research released a study showing that South Korean Samsung has been ousted as the biggest earner from semiconductor manufacturing. Intel took pole position with $50.5 billion in 2023 revenue, with the U.S. company taking a 9.7% market share that year. Samsung had an 8.3% share.

North Korea TV censors Alan Titchmarsh's trousers - BBC News BBC Homepage Skip to content Accessibility Help Your account Home News Sport Earth Reel Worklife Travel More menu More menu Search BBC Home News Sport Earth Reel Worklife Travel Culture Future Music TV Weather Sounds Close menu BBC News Menu Home Israel-Gaza war War in Ukraine Climate Video World Asia UK Business Tech More Science Entertainment & Arts Health World News TV In Pictures BBC Verify Newsbeat Asia China India North Korea TV censors Alan Titchmarsh's trousers Published 26 March Share close panel Share page Copy link About sharing Image source, KCTV By Alistair Coleman BBC Monitoring North Korea's state television channel has censored a BBC gardening programme - by blurring out presenter Alan Titchmarsh's trousers. Central TV aired a 2010 edition of Alan Titchmarsh's Garden Secrets for its morning audience, but made sure that viewers could not see his jeans. Jeans are seen as a symbol of western imperialism in the secretive state and as such are banned. Mr Titchmarsh said the news has given him "a bit of street cred". "It's taken me to reach the age of 74 to be regarded in the same sort of breath as Elvis Presley, Tom Jones, Rod Stewart. You know wearing trousers that are generally considered by those of us of a sensitive disposition to be rather too tight," he told the BBC. He then went on to say that his jeans were not too tight, but were clearly not acceptable in North Korea. He said: "I've never seen myself as a dangerous subversive imperialist - I'm generally regarded as rather cosy and pretty harmless, so actually it's given me a bit of street cred really hasn't it?" North Korea's rules prohibiting jeans have been in place since the 1990s. Back then, leader Kim Jong-il declared denim trousers to be a symbol of Western - and specifically American - imperialism, which had no place in a socialist state, according to Seoul-based NK News . In recent years, a crackdown on Western culture has reiterated this ban, with state-run newspaper Rodong Sinmun telling citizens in 2020 to reject what it termed "bourgeois culture" in favour of a "superior socialist lifestyle". Current leader Kim Jong-un, himself a fan of voluminous legwear, is reportedly irked by skinny jeans and T-shirts bearing Western logos which are popular in South Korea. How did North Korea get hold of a BBC programme? Western programming is extremely rare on North Korean screens, as the regime is careful - to the point of paranoia - about allowing foreign culture to enter the country. Yet this is not the first time Garden Secrets has been aired before on Central TV, with Mr Titchmarsh saying he was "surprised" to appear on screens in the Communist state. But it is still not entirely clear how it arrived in North Korea in the first place. While satellite dishes and access to the global internet are banned except for the very few trusted classes in Pyongyang, foreign media still arrives in the country, often on memory cards smuggled over the Chinese border. Owning or trading in foreign media is illegal. How much do we know about North Korea? However, North Korean TV often pirates content from foreign broadcasters, blurring out onscreen logos to hide the original source. This is often the case with their airing of Premier League, Champions League, and International football. In 2014, during one of North Korea's periods of connecting with the West, there were discussions suggesting possibly gifting UK television programmes to the East Asian state as a means of demonstrating so-called "soft-power". The Sunday Times revealed in 2014 that BBC Worldwide - the former name of the corporation's commercial arm BBC Studios - and the Foreign Office were hoping to "open [the North Korean] people's eyes to the world beyond the closed republic without offending the regime". The paper quoted a Whitehall official as saying: "Programmes sent to North Korea would have to be something that isn't offensive, like Mr Bean, EastEnders, Miss Marple or Poirot. "You couldn't send Dad's Army, as it is about war. But Teletubbies could be an option, or The Good Life, with a bit of gardening and squabbling in the kitchen". It's not known if Alan Titchmarsh's Garden Secrets was part of this package, or even if the programmes were delivered at all.

The tournament is the Homeless World Cup, and to promote his new film The Beautiful Game, the Oscar-nominated actor has turned up to the real-life trials for the next event in South Korea. "I didn't know anything about the Homeless World Cup before, but it really is a simple and sensational idea," Nighy says. Image source, Netflix For him, one of the best things about being part of the film was meeting the extras who had participated in real tournaments and are now no longer homeless. "It's a very sweet bit of symmetry," Nighy tells the BBC. The Homeless World Cup involves a four-a-side format, and the film strips football back to its basics - removing the fame, money and power that are sometimes associated with the game. Although The Beautiful Game shows the potential for sport to create change, the actor - a Crystal Palace fan - confesses he's not sure whether football actually has that power. "I'm not sure really," he says. "But I think it does bring everyone closer and brings people from all of the world together. It's a universal language for about half of the world, and I think to some degree it can alleviate prejudice." England's real coach for the Homeless World Cup is Frankie Juma, who started playing football in the UK when he joined a refugee team. Image caption, Frankie Juma started playing for a refugee team when he came to the UK from Sudan He says he wanted to become a coach in order to give back to the community. "It's nice to do something that gives back to the country that gave me a safe space, and I like helping people and making those that had similar experiences to me feel comfortable." At Juma's training sessions, it's not just about football. "We probably do 30% football and 70% support because the people that come to us often need access to education or services such as housing, which is a huge issue right now," he explains. Juma is now on the hunt for eight men who will represent England at the forthcoming Homeless World Cup in September.

Media caption, The Sudanese refugee taking England's homeless football to the world cup One player that has caught his eye is 35-year-old Courtney, who has had his share of ups and downs. "I'm getting back into football now because it really helps me de-stress and it makes me forget about everything in life, because I just want to have fun and build up my fitness," he says. Football has helped him avoid homelessness, he says. "If I'm out here, I'm not doing things I shouldn't be." Image caption, Courtney says football helps him take his mind off other things Courtney says it would be a dream to represent England. "Some people would say I'm the black Tony Adams, and if we stay focused there is no reason why we can't go all the way." One member of the film's cast who particularly related to Courtney's experience of homelessness is Micheal Ward. Ward plays Vinny, a star player who is living in his car after his relationship broke down, and the Top Boy actor himself experienced homelessness growing up. "Me and my family have been homeless many times and I hadn't realised it because my mum would try to cover it up, and the times she wasn't able to do that she would make a joke about it. So I never understood the seriousness behind it," he tells the BBC. Image source, Netflix Image caption, Micheal Ward experienced homelessness growing up Ward found a new perspective on homelessness after spending time with the film's extras, who were former participants in the Homeless World Cup. "I want people to take away the idea that you shouldn't judge a book by its cover. I'm guilty of doing that and seeing people on the street thinking, what the hell? But you realise that a lot of the situations they are in are not their fault, or they are spiralling and we don't know the source of that. "I now try to be more aware and do a little bit more to help." 'I've come full circle' Raph Aziz is a former Homeless World Cup player who represented England at the 2018 tournament in Mexico. The 32-year-old came to the UK 12 years ago and experienced homelessness and prison time before finding accommodation at a Salvation Army hostel for four years. While there, he joined a football project and his passion for the sport continued to grow. "There's a clear before and after for me," he says. "When I came back from the tournament in 2018, I was full of confidence, had the ability to network, made loads of friends, and felt really inspired to give back to the community." The Homeless World Cup's founder Mel Young, who also set up the Big Issue Scotland, says the power of sport to create a community should not be underestimated. "The power of sport is actually really understated, and I think we need to use sport more as it is a common language that people can understand." After the competition, Aziz chose to train as a charity worker for the organisation that helped support him when he first arrived. "I've been full circle since my homeless days and it is all thanks to the opportunities the Homeless World Cup gave me." The Beautiful Game is on Netflix from Friday, 29 March.

The country’s movies have similarly captivated audiences from all nations, with South Korean cinema’s bold storytelling, rich characters, and innovative filmmaking techniques garnering attention from fans and critics, not to mention award-giving bodies. Contents 7. Burning (2018) 6. The Handmaiden (2016) 5. Oldboy (2003) 4. Memories of Murder (2003) 3. The Wailing (2016) 2. The Housemaid (1960) 1. Parasite (2019) Show 2 more items From twisty thrillers like Oldboy and Memories of Murder to global sensations like Parasite and Decision to Leave , South Korean cinema has become a staple for cinephiles. Its best movies span a variety of genres and come from different generations, with each one highlighting all the different aspects and unique elements that make the country’s films worth discovering and celebrating. Recommended Videos 7. Burning (2018) CGV Arthouse Directed by Lee Chang-dong, Burning is a must-see psychological thriller with a deceptively simple plot. The film follows Jong-su (Yoo Ah-in), a young aspiring writer who reconnects with his childhood friend, Hae-mi (Jeon Jong-seo). Hae-mi asks Jong-su to take care of her cat while she travels to Africa, but upon her return, she introduces him to Ben ( Beef ‘s Steven Yeun), a rich man she met during her trip. Jong-su soon becomes suspicious of Ben’s intentions and relationship with Hae-mi, especially as they learn about the stranger’s bizarre hobby. Related 7 best Robert Downey Jr. movies, ranked 7 best Star Trek villains, ranked 7 best British comedy movies ever, ranked Burning is a slow-burn movie, with the thriller taking its time to build an atmosphere that’s both mesmerizing and uneasy during its first half. By the time its more dramatic events unfold, viewers are likely already completely immersed in the haunting film’s world. The 2018 movie takes its time to tell its story that’s inextricably linked with class and wealth disparity, rewarding patient audiences with an unexpected ending they will remember. 6. The Handmaiden (2016) CJ Entertainment The Handmaiden is a gorgeous psychological thriller set in 1930s South Korea. In it, a young Japanese heiress, Lady Hideko (Kim Min-hee), meets her new handmaiden, Sook-Hee (Kim Tae-ri). Unbeknownst to Lady Hideko, Sook-Hee is part of a scheme orchestrated by a charming conman posing as a count, Fujiwara (Ha Jung-woo), who intends to steal her inheritance. What nobody expects is the genuine love that Lady Hideko starts to develop for Sook-Hee, who begins to feel conflicted about the plan. Director Park Chan-wook is known for his talent for visual storytelling, with The Handmaiden being among the greatest examples of his skill. Aside from being a visually stunning film, the thriller is also full of deliciously dark humor and surprisingly intense and emotional depictions of romance, betrayal, and sexual desire. It’s a stylish and provocative work full of surprises that can shock or impress, depending on who’s watching. 5. Oldboy (2003) Show East / Show East Director Park Chan-wook’s Oldboy is a renowned neo-noir action thriller centered on a man named Oh Dae-su (Choi Min-sik), who is one day kidnapped and then mysteriously imprisoned in a cell for 15 years for seemingly no reason. Upon his sudden release, he makes it his mission to discover who was responsible for his suffering, only to find himself walking into a conspiracy that could be much worse than his confinement. Oldboy is one of the most violent action movies ever , with its flawlessly choreographed fight sequences and bloody interactions involving torture being unflinching all throughout. One particular hallway scene has become popular for the exhilarating way Oh Dae-su takes down several goons with a hammer. Of course, the 2003 movie is best known for its infamous plot twist, which leaves viewers with an incredibly disturbing ending that they won’t see coming. 4. Memories of Murder (2003) CJ Entertainment Before the international hit that was Parasite , director Bong Joon-ho was already crafting intriguing thrillers like Memories of Murder . The 2003 neo-noir crime thriller is centered on a messy investigation led by detectives Park Doo-man (Song Kang-ho) and Seo Tae-yoon (Kim Sang-kyung) following gruesome murders in rural South Korea. They race against the clock to capture the unknown serial killer who targets young women. Memories of Murder is difficult enough to watch at times, but it becomes even more unsettling when viewers learn that it’s based on a real string of crimes from the 1980s known as the Hwaseong serial murders. An expertly made crime movie , Memories of Murder greatly benefits from Bong Joon-ho’s direction, as the filmmaker infuses it with his trademark meticulous visuals and a ton of dark humor that doesn’t take away from the gravity of its story. 3. The Wailing (2016) 20th Century Fox The Wailing is a genre-busting work by director Na Hong-jin, with the 2016 movie revolving around a small village plagued by a mysterious illness and a series of brutal murders. Police officer Jong-goo (Kwak Do-won) investigates the bizarre and dangerous events but soon encounters a sinister shaman (Hwang Jung-min) and a mysterious stranger (Jun Kunimura) rumored to be behind the chaos. Director Na Hong-jin’s film is a fantastic blend of several horror and thriller subgenres, as it’s a possession, zombie, police procedural, drama, and even comedy all at once. It’s a slow-burn movie that showcases familiar horror tropes used in unfamiliar ways, making full use of clever cultural references and even mythology to weave its suspenseful story. Whichever way audiences want to look at it, The Wailing undeniably offers a wholly original viewing experience that horror fans will especially appreciate. 2. The Housemaid (1960) Kuk Dong Seki Trading Co. One of South Korea’s classic movies worth streaming today , 1960’s The Housemaid is a provocative domestic horror film that follows the chaos that unfolds after a middle-class family hires a young housemaid, Myeong-sook (Lee Eun-shim). She soon has an illicit affair with the family’s patriarch (Kim Jin-kyu), leading to a series of shocking and tragic events that cause the entire family to unravel. Directed by Kim Ki-young, The Housemaid was a groundbreaking and subversive masterpiece that challenged societal and gender norms in South Korean society. Its sexually predatory femme fatale is a cleverly written and wonderfully portrayed character that embodies the unfair pressure put on women, particularly those from lower-class backgrounds. Unsurprisingly, these themes helped the film hold up incredibly well, with its message remaining relevant in any country today. It also spawned a trilogy that would explore similar subjects, with its sequels titled Woman of Fire and Woman of Fire ’82 . 1. Parasite (2019) CJ Entertainment / CJ Entertainment Parasite is a modern masterpiece that needs no introduction. A satire, thriller, and comedy, it tells the story of the Kim family, who are used to poverty but soon find a way to temporarily escape it and experience the way the other side lives. Each family member achieves this by posing as a skilled worker for the affluent Park family, which is a scheme that seems flawless for a while, at least until the midpoint revelation. The influential thriller with an infamous twist quickly turned director Bong Joon-ho into a household name following its premiere in 2019. After gaining international acclaim, Parasite also broke new ground in Hollywood by becoming the first ever non-English-language movie to win the Academy Award for Best Picture. The cinematic landmark has received numerous accolades and praise for its novel eat-the-rich narrative told with stylistic visuals, witty, dark humor, and scathing social commentary.

On the plus side, you have franchises like the new Star Trek movies and Guardians of the Galaxy, where the sequels aren't necessarily bad, they're just more of the same. On the bad end, you're left with what most sequels become: desperate attempts from studios to make more money by churning out absolute garbage, like Son of the Mask, Basic Instinct 2, Sex and the City 2, and Legally Blonde 2: Red, White, and Blonde.

Here’s how it works . Gaming A new Xbox Dev Kit was just certified in South Korea — could this be an Xbox "Pro?" News By Michael Hoglund published 19 March 2024 Could this be a new Pro version of the Xbox Series X or the handheld that's been rumored for so long? Comments (2) (Image credit: Windows Central) What you should know A new Xbox Developer Kit has passed the certification process in South Korea as of March 18. The National Radio Research Agency checks all electronic devices for use in Korea. This agency has previously checked the Xbox One X and the Xbox Series X|S. It's not known what this kit is for. It could be an Xbox handheld, all-digital Xbox Series X, Xbox Series Pro, or something else entirely. The PlayStation 5 Pro has been the talk of the week for hardware. Various outlets reported specs for the rumored PS5 Pro , and a rumored investigation is taking place within Sony regarding how the leak occurred. It's been relatively quiet on the Xbox front — at least, until today. Now, we have our own speculations to make. The Xbox News for Koreans site has spotted a new Xbox Developer Kit in South Korea. A screenshot posted to their Twitter shows that a new XDK has passed the Nation Radio Research Agency certification. Why is this a big deal, exactly? Oh, what's this? (Image credit: Xbox News for Koreans) According to Xbox News for Koreans, all electronic devices must be certified by the National Radio Research Agency to determine they won't harm radio waves. Failure to have the device certified means it can't be used within the country. As a result, Xbox has passed at least three prior Xbox Developer Kits through the National Radio Research Agency. This included the Xbox One X and Xbox Series X|S. You can independently verify this by checking out the National Radio Research Agency website . Switch to English using a translator if you're unfamiliar with Korean; search for the term "XDK Console." You can see some dates that are close to the launch of significant Xbox consoles. (Image credit: Future via Michael Hoglund) Top recommendations • Best Xbox headsets • Best Windows laptops • Best Xbox storage • Best gaming laptops What this is can only be guessed. It could be any number of rumored projects in the works, like the Xbox handheld or all-digital Xbox Series X. Another possibility, while less plausible, is an Xbox Series Pro. Based on Sarah Bond's comments during their recent business update, it's not likely to be a next-gen console. As she mentioned, a new device will be shown this holiday, whereas a next-gen console will be available later. I've seen many fans eager for an Xbox Pro on social media, joined by other fans who couldn't care less. The main argument is playing the all-power-consuming GTA 6 on a device capable of running it at 60 frames per second. In what many are guessing could be another genre-defining entry in the series, why wouldn't you want to play it on the best possible system? Especially since there's no current PC release. I find myself somewhere in the middle. I get that players want more power; I do, too. Heck, that's why I play on my PC just as much as I do on my Xbox. However, I want some new technology behind it—I want a next-gen console. Get the Windows Central Newsletter All the latest news, reviews, and guides for Windows and Xbox diehards.

If rumors are to be believed—and they never should be entirely—the PS5 Pro is launching with a modified RDNA 3.0, not the RDNA 4.0 rumored to be releasing this fall with the new lineup of AMD cards. It's also using the same CPU with a 10% bump in clock speed. Digital Foundry determined that even at lower resolutions, Starfield was CPU bound in many places. (Image credit: Digital Foundry) I want something that uses new technology, like the speculated use of AI upscaling Sony could be utilizing, called PSSR. I want Microsoft to use additional new tech like RDNA 4.0, their own AI upscaling, and, most importantly, an entirely new CPU. Open-world games like the upcoming GTA 6 and Starfield are CPU-hungry and demand a more suitable processor to run them. Even at low settings, a game like Star Citizen will fall well below 30 FPS in numerous areas on an AMD 3600, an equivalent CPU that powers the Xbox Series X|S, the rumored PlayStation 5 Pro, and PlayStation 5 console. If gamers want these gigantic open worlds to be playable at anything beyond 30 frames per second, they need a better CPU. Plain and simple. Something Digital Foundry has shown multiple times, most recently with Starfield. If this ends up being a mid-gen refresh, I want it to be more capable. I want a proper reason to spend another $500 plus on some new-fangled device. That is unless that device is handheld (I would love one of those too!) What about you? What do you think the device is?

TOPICS Xbox Xbox Series X refresh Xbox handheld Xbox Series X Xbox Series S CATEGORIES Gaming See all comments (2) 2 Comments Comment from the forums GraniteStateColin With near-perfect backward compatibility, the arguments against a tech update are diminished. But one big one remains: for customers who recently purchased an Xbox Series X|S, if a new system comes out that doesn't at least require a version of newly released games still run on those models (like the current requirements for Series X games to also run on Series S), they would rightly feel cheated. So, as long as all games still run on Series S and X, even if only at 30fps, then I see no reason not to do as big an update as possible. Having said that, I think the easiest and most logical update is to focus on the terrible ray tracing capabilities inherent to the AMD GPU. It's not clear to me that even RDNA 4 will reach parity with Nvidia on ray tracing and path tracing, but AMD has said that's their focus. They've even said that raster performance may decrease between GPU generations in order to channel all improvements into ray tracing -- a smart compromise, if true. For me, ray tracing (and even more so path tracing) is far more visually compelling than the update from 1080p to 4K at any given framerate. A new system that is functionally the same as the prior models but has the GPU to enable ray tracing/path tracing in games would be a solid mid-gen refresh. This would mean that the same games play identically (or nearly identically) on both, but look far better on the new model. Doesn't help with this generation (assuming even games optimized for the new system will still need to run on Series X|S), but perhaps for next-gen, if GPUs are sufficiently performant to reliably provide path-tracing support for most games, that also becomes a HUGE time saver to developers who can eliminate all the time they spend (waste) baking in lighting tricks. I think we're still a few years from this, but the first generation of consoles with graphics capabilities at this level will allow game devs to start thinking this way. That's the next big leap in gaming, because it will be like a huge gift to every dev team (eliminating all that time spent on fake lighting tricks). Reply Xbox Vince I hope it's a more powerful Series S with the latest Bluetooth and usb-c port.

Mr Kim was animated as he spoke to a military official in a field next to several large rocket launchers. Korean Central Television said the drill aimed to test the "real war capabilities" of the launchers and their operators.

Evelyn Hockstein/Reuters, FILE When President Joe Biden hosts Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida at the White House for an official visit Wednesday, a senior administration official tells ABC News the two countries will make "historic" announcements that will take the U.S.-Japan alliance to "new heights." This official said the leaders will unveil more than 70 programs and initiatives. Many of the announcements will focus on deepening defense ties, furthering cooperation between Japan and other allies, and new updates on Japan's efforts to acquire Tomahawk land attack missiles from the U.S. The summit is also expected to include steps that would allow the countries to work on joint development -- and potentially co-production -- of vital military and defense equipment, according to Deputy Secretary of State Kurt Campbell in remarks last week. There will also be new cooperation in space, artificial intelligence, quantum computing, and climate change, the official said.

The visit underscores how the mutual threat from China, North Korea and Russia are driving these two allies even closer together. The two countries want to deter China and prepare for any conflict that could emerge. Russia's invasion of Ukraine has made Japan more worried about China trying to move on Taiwan. A state visit is a huge honor, and it signals to the world how close the relationship is and marks milestones in the relationship.

These are just some of the ways that China’s influence operations have ramped up their use of artificial intelligence to sow disinformation and stoke discord worldwide over the last seven months, according to a new report released Friday by Microsoft Threat Intelligence. Microsoft has observed notable trends from state-backed actors, the report said, “that demonstrate not only doubling down on familiar targets, but also attempts to use more sophisticated influence techniques to achieve their goals.” In particular, Chinese influence actors “experimented with new media” and “continued to refine AI-generated or AI-enhanced content.” Among the operations highlighted in the report was a “a notable uptick in content featuring Taiwanese political figures ahead of the January 13 presidential and legislative elections.” This included an AI-generated audio recording, posted by a Chinese Communist Party (CCP)-linked group known as Storm-1376 or “Spamouflage,” that made it falsely appear like Foxconn owner Terry Gou, who had mounted a short-lived independent presidential campaign, had endorsed another candidate, when he in fact did not. Microsoft also recorded the dissemination of AI-generated news anchors as well as AI-generated memes to mislead audiences and influence Taiwan’s elections. Read More: Taiwan’s Election Isn’t a Disaster for Xi—Unless He Makes It One “This was the first time that Microsoft Threat Intelligence has witnessed a nation state actor using AI content in attempts to influence a foreign election,” the report said, warning that “as populations in India, South Korea, and the United States head to the polls, we are likely to see Chinese cyber and influence actors, and to some extent North Korean cyber actors, work toward targeting these elections.” Read More: All the Elections Around the World in 2024 China’s influence operations observed by Microsoft extended beyond Taiwan during the last several months, too. Last August, Storm-1376 launched a multilingual “large-scale, aggressive messaging campaign,” including through AI-generated memes, to amplify Chinese propaganda and stoke international public anger—especially among South Koreans —over Japan’s disposal of nuclear wastewater from Fukushima last year. Read More: China’s Concern About Nuclear Wastewater May Be More About Politics Than Science Microsoft also pointed to multiple instances of Storm-1376 spreading conspiratorial narratives “ultimately encouraging mistrust of and disillusionment with the U.S. government.” After the devastating wildfires that ripped through Maui last August, Storm-1376 posted on “dozens of websites and platforms” that the fires were caused by the U.S. military testing a “weather weapon,” accompanied with AI-generated photos of flames raging along roads and buildings “to make the content more eye-catching,” the Microsoft report said. And in the days after a train derailment in Kentucky in November, a social media campaign by Storm-1376 urged audiences to consider that it was orchestrated by the U.S. government, which it said was “deliberately hiding something.” Microsoft said the disinformation campaign likened the derailment to 9/11 and Pearl Harbor cover-up theories. In addition, Microsoft highlighted U.S.-election focused influence operations through “sockpuppet” accounts posing as Americans and “sometimes enhanced through generative AI.” The Microsoft Threat Analysis Center had previously reported that social media accounts very likely affiliated with the CCP impersonated U.S. voters to influence the 2022 midterm elections. “This activity has continued and these accounts nearly exclusively post about divisive U.S. domestic issues such as global warming, U.S. border policies, drug use, immigration, and racial tensions,” the center said on Friday, adding that the campaign has adopted an increasing focus on asking questions and seeking perspectives—what amounts to “effectively, polling questions” about contentious topics in the U.S.—indicating “a deliberate effort to understand better which U.S. voter demographic supports what issue or position and which topics are the most divisive.” Despite the growing sophistication involved in these influence operations, however, there remains little evidence that they have been successful in changing public opinion, Microsoft notes. “While the impact of such content in swaying audiences remains low,” said the Microsoft report, “China’s increasing experimentation in augmenting memes, videos, and audio will continue—and may prove effective down the line.” Additional cyber threats Besides influence operations, Chinese cyber actors have also infiltrated important networks used by its adversaries. Last year, it compromised telecommunication entities in the South China Sea around the time of U.S. military drills, including in Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Cambodia, and Taiwan. China has been embroiled in maritime territorial disputes in the region with Southeast Asian states, which have long looked to the U.S. for strategic defense support. Read More: Is Southeast Asia Leaning More Toward China? New Survey Shows Mixed Results FBI director Christopher Wray warned a congressional committee in January about Chinese hackers targeting critical U.S. infrastructure such as water treatment plants, electric grids, energy pipelines, and transportation. In February, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency said that several of such critical infrastructure were confirmed to have been compromised by Chinese state-sponsored cyber group Volt Typhoon , whose operations Microsoft also outlined in its latest report. North Korea was also documented in the Microsoft report, as continuing to loot cryptocurrency for state revenue and looking to AI tools to enhance its cyber operations. It was also found to have continued targeting aerospace and defense organizations in the U.S. and South Korea, as well as diplomats, government officials, and think tank experts—in what Microsoft assesses as “intelligence collection.” Microsoft has been embattled by criticisms from U.S. lawmakers over its concessions to China and failure to fend off Chinese threats. This week, a federal report blamed Microsoft for its “inadequate” security culture, claiming that a “cascade of avoidable errors” by the company allowed Chinese cyber actors to access senior U.S. officials’ emails accounts, which were hosted by Microsoft Exchange Online. In response, Microsoft said that the hackers were “well-resourced nation state threat actors who operate continuously and without meaningful deterrence” but vowed to “adopt a new culture of engineering security in our own networks.” More Must-Reads From TIME The 100 Most Influential People of 2024 The Revolution of Yulia Navalnaya 6 Compliments That Land Every Time What's the Deal With the Bitcoin Halving?

#DisarmRussia #Disarm Russia Send a letter to your representative Disarm Russia Without Western CNCs, Russiа's military production will degrade within a few years What is CNC? CNC (Computer numerical control) machine tools are automated robot machines using software to manufacture various metal products without direct human intervention. CNC machinery is a crucial means of production for advanced arms manufacturing like missiles, aircrafts, radars etc. Millions suffer from the genocidal war in Europe - killed, injured, deported, tortured in occupation. Western companies helped Russia prepare for the big war. What products do CNC machines make? CNC machining provides a high level of precision and repeatability, making it ideal for producing critical components for the military complex. Aircraft Components CNC machines are used to manufacture precision parts for military aircraft, such as engine components, landing gear parts, and structural elements. Weapon Systems CNC machining is crucial in the production of firearm components, missile guidance systems, and other weapon parts. Armor and Vehicle Components CNC machining is used to create armored vehicle components, including body panels, turrets, and structural elements. Electronic and Communication Equipment CNC machines are used in the production of electronic components, communication equipment, and radar systems for military use. All in all — there is not a single russian tank, plane, APC that does not have parts made with foreign CNC machine tools . How important is CNC machinery for the Russian arms manufacturing industry? According to research by ESCU , a leading think tank, foreign-made CNC tools compose roughly 70% of Russia’s annual consumption (this was never a secret, and was widely published in the media even before the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022). Hence, Russia's overall military production capacity depends on a handful of dual-use technology manufacturers from Japan, Germany, Italy, Switzerland, Taiwan, South Korea. 70% 70% of CNC consumed by Russia - are imported Whose products are there in the Russian military complex? Big Cases of CNCs’ sanction evasion: Russia has worked around European Union sanctions to import banned equipment used for military purposes via countries such as Turkey, the United Arab Emirates and others. HAAS public case investigation by PBS, reported by Simon Ostrovsky with support from the Pulitzer Center. Learn More The latest break-out story by Die Zeit accuses German engineering company DMG Mori of fueling Russian military production.

Send a Letter to Your Representative Go to https://democracy.io to send the following letter to your representatives in less than 30 seconds. Hi, my name is ENTER NAME, and I live in your district — my zip code is ENTER ZIP.  While Ukraine continues to valiantly defend itself, Russia has significantly increased its domestic military production. This production is only possible with CNCs - computer numerical control machines, which are necessary for high-precision industries, and are produced almost exclusively in the West, Japan and South Korea. Neither Russia nor China are able to produce high-end CNCs.  Russia had acquired a substantial number of Western CNC machines before the full-scale invasion, but continues to import even more. Current sanctions allow many dual-use products essential to Russian weapon manufacturing to cross borders unimpeded. Furthermore, all CNC machines require servicing from manufacturers. As long as Russia has access to CNC machines - it will be able to produce advanced weapons.  Ukraine has already asked Germany to halt CNC deliveries to Russia: https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-09-18/ukraine-asks-germany-to-halt-ammunition-tool-headed-for-russia, an investigation by PBS revealed that American HAAS may still be supplying the Russian arms industry, and other cases abound.  It’s like in the proverb; give a man a fish, and you feed him for a day. Teach a man to fish, and you feed him for a lifetime. By giving Russia the tools it needs to produce weapons, we are not only prolonging the war, but forcing ourselves to provide Ukraine with more weaponry.  By implementing sanctions and bolstering export controls on CNCs from the US and our allies, Russian arms manufacturing will significantly diminish over time. This is a realistic political goal that can have a tremendous impact.  As your constituent, Thank you for your support.

Reeves April 6, 2024 7:00 AM EDT Richard V. Reeves is president of the American Institute for Boys and Men and author of Of Boys and Men: Why the Modern Male Is Struggling, Why It Matters, and What to Do about It (Brookings Institution Press, 2022). T here are three facts about South Korea that it would be wise to pay attention to. First, the nation’s fertility rate has plummeted to below one child per woman, which means a nation of around 50 million people today will shrink by half in just a generation. Second, the current President, Yoon Suk Yeol , won election in 2022 on an explicitly anti-feminist agenda , with a promise to abolish the ministry for gender equality. Third, there is a massive political divide in the country between young men and young women. These trends are inextricably related. Young men and young women do not see their interests as being aligned, but in conflict. As politics gets more divided between the sexes, maternity wards get quieter . And where South Korea leads, many fear that other advanced economies may follow. Similar political gaps are opening up in the U.S., for example. The normal pattern is of left-right divides between generations, with younger voters typically more liberal than older ones. But in recent years a remarkable political chasm around the world has opened up between men and women within a generation, specifically Gen Z. Data from Gallup shows that in the U.S., women aged 18 to 30 are now 30 percentage points more liberal than their male counterparts. This gender gap in ideology is five times wider than in 2000, and wider than at any previous point in polling history. There are similar gaps in Germany and the U.K. and much starker divides in South Korea and China. This new trend has political scientists scratching their heads. “This points to a real risk of fractious division among this coming generation of young—and the need to listen carefully to both,” says Professor Bobby Duffy of King’s College London, a leading expert on politics and generational change. A shared trend is a turning away from feminism among young men, even as women turn more strongly toward it. A 2023 survey by Equimundo found that just 47% of men in the U.S. aged 18 to 23 agreed with the statement that “feminism has made America a better place,” compared with 56% of men aged 38 to 45. This is a shocking development. Daniel Cox, a scholar at the center-right American Enterprise Institute think-tank, is documenting these trends closely in the U.S., arguing that “at no time in the past quarter century has there been such a rapid divergence between the views of young men and women.” Perhaps what’s most troubling here is the rise of zero-sum thinking with regard to gender. Some 38% of Republican men, for example, agree with the statement that “the gains women have made in society have come at the expense of men.” Zero-sum calculations of this kind, not only with regard to gender but also race or immigration, can lead to the political equivalent of trench warfare , with each side digging in that leaves everyone worse off. In a zero-sum political environment, merely drawing attention to the problems of boys and men can be seen as somehow downplaying the ongoing challenges facing girls and women. This is why Democrats, in particular, are so reluctant to directly address male issues. That is a recipe for bad politics. But the cultural consequences of this neglect are even more important. Many American men feel like their concerns—in mental health, education, work, and family life—are not taken seriously enough. And they are not entirely wrong about that. The suicide rate is four times higher for men than women, and has risen by a third among young men since 2010. Women and girls are leaving boys and men in the dust in the classroom and on college campuses . Over the last few decades, wages for working class men have stagnated. These are real problems. And problems become grievances if they are neglected. As Daniel Schwammenthal, director of the American Jewish Committee’s Transatlantic Institute, says, “The iron rule of politics is that if there are real problems in society and responsible parties don’t deal with them, the irresponsible parties will jump on them.” As the work of AEI’s Cox shows, one of the big differences between young men and women is not just along partisan lines, but with regard to the importance of politics altogether. While young women feel strongly about a wide range of issues, from the environment to reproductive rights, young men are simply not as engaged . In Cox’s polling, there is no single major issue where young men are more engaged than young women. More than turning to the right, young men are turning away from politics altogether. This is not surprising when the progressive left offers an echoing silence on men’s issues, and the reactionary right offers fiery rhetoric but no real solutions. Disenchanted, many simply shrug their shoulders. The chasm opening up between young men and women does not augur well on a number of fronts. First, it is likely to entrench polarization, if these political divisions turn out to be lasting. Second, the political divide could lead to lower rates of family formation—after all, who wants to sleep with the enemy?—and potentially even lower fertility rates . Third, a permanent ideological canyon between men and women is likely to worsen wellbeing. In part, this is because family life is typically an anchor for our identity and purpose. We are already at risk of a “ friendship recession .” Fraying ties between men and women could make it deeper. Back in 1975, the cultural anthropologist Margaret Mead observed the early signs of some gender divergence. “Roles are changing for both men and women,” she wrote. “Women are being pressured ... to believe that their past status was brought about by male oppression. At the same time men ... are being accused of being oppressors—and angry oppressors at that. The whole process of change is taking place in an atmosphere of the greatest bad temper.” After a period of relative calm in the sex wars, we are in danger of entering another period of bad temper. But this time, the stakes are even higher.

Article 23, as it's known locally, was unanimously passed by the city's pro-Beijing parliament, targeting a range of offences deemed treasonous. Officials say the law is essential for stability but opponents called it a "nail in the city's coffin". China has long pushed for the law and said "smears" by critics would fail. The new law allows for closed-door trials, gives the police rights to detain suspects for up to 16 days without charge and penalties including life sentences, among other things. "The new national security legislation is going to double down the repression on freedoms in Hong Kong with extended egregious sentences and a broadened definition of national security," said Frances Hui, an activist now based in the US, who described the legislation as a "final nail in a closed coffin". A group of 81 lawmakers and public figures from across the world, including in the UK, US, Canada and South Korea, issued a joint statement on Tuesday expressing "grave concerns" over the legislation, which expands on the National Security Law imposed by Beijing in 2020, and criminalises secession, subversion, terrorism and collusion with foreign forces. "The legislation undermines due process and fair trial rights and violates Hong Kong's obligations under international human rights law, jeopardising Hong Kong's role as an open international city," the statement said, calling it yet another "devastating blow" for freedom. What is Hong Kong's tough new security law? Hong Kong's year under China's controversial law The US said it was "alarmed" by the "sweeping and... vaguely-defined" provisions in the legislation, a concern echoed by the EU, which said the law could affect the city's status as a business centre. Meanwhile, the UK's Foreign Secretary David Cameron said the law would "further damage rights and freedoms" and "entrench a culture of self-censorship " in the former British colony. Hongkongers have told the BBC how they are already being careful with what they say to friends and colleagues, fearing an "informant culture" has developed in the city. Lord Cameron's comments sparked a strong response from the Chinese Embassy in the UK, which rubbished his remarks as "a serious distortion of the facts". China's government also hit back at the criticisms of Article 23, saying it is "unswervingly determined to safeguard national sovereignty, security and development interests, implement the 'one country, two systems' policy, and oppose any external interference in Hong Kong affairs". "All attacks and smears will never succeed and are doomed to fail," foreign ministry spokesman Lin Jian told a regular press conference in Beijing. Image source, Getty Images Image caption, More than 260 people were arrested since the huge protests against the 2020 national security law Hong Kong's leader John Lee had earlier also defended the law - which was fast-tracked through its final phase on Tuesday - saying the legislation would help the city "effectively prevent, suppress and punish espionage activities, conspiracies and traps from foreign intelligence agencies, and infiltration and sabotage by hostile forces". "From now on, the people of Hong Kong will no longer experience these harms and sorrows," he added. But those who led the pro-democracy protests against China's increasing influence on the city see the new law as yet another lost battle. It brings Hong Kong "one step closer to the system of mainland China", former Hong Kong lawmaker Nathan Law, who is now in exile in the UK, told the BBC's Newsday programme. "The chilling effect... and the result of a collapse of civil society is impacting most Hong Kong people." Ms Hui, who is now Policy and Advocacy Coordinator at the Committee for Freedom in Hong Kong Foundation, said she is also concerned the law could also be used to target HongKongers overseas, or their families and friends back home. The city has previously offered bounties for information on activists who fled overseas, and arrested four people in Hong Kong for supporting people abroad who "endanger national security". Ms Hui left Hong Kong in 2020 after Beijing imposed the NSL that has since seen more than 260 people arrested. It was introduced in response to massive pro-democracy protests which engulfed the city in 2019. She said civil liberties in Hong Kong are "long gone" four years after the NSL took effect. Chris Patten, Hong Kong's last British governor, described the legislation as "another large nail in the coffin of human rights and the rule of law in Hong Kong and a further disgraceful breach of the Joint Declaration". Hong Kong was handed back by the UK to China in 1997 under the principle of "one country, two systems", which guaranteed the city a certain degree of autonomy. While Beijing and Hong Kong both insist this is still the case, critics and international rights groups say China's grip on the city has only tightened with time.

Indeed, the U.S. has ramped up its partnership-building, particularly in the Indo-Pacific, as it seems to seek to establish a countervailing force to China’s growing influence and assertiveness in the region. In just the last three years, the U.S. has solidified individual ties with Japan , Vietnam , the Philippines , and Singapore , among others, as well as fostered new collective relationships between nations such as Japan and South Korea , Australia and the U.K. , and now Japan and the Philippines. Read More: ​​Is Southeast Asia Leaning More Toward China? New Survey Shows Mixed Results It’s a strategy that analysts say reflects not just the U.S.’s diplomatic goals but also growing wariness of China in its own backyard. “None of this would be happening if states like the Philippines, Japan, and several states in Southeast Asia, were all not quite worried about China’s behavior,” Evan Resnick, senior associate fellow at the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies (RSIS), tells TIME. More from TIME While the U.S. has focused on improving economic ties, too, in the region, there’s no denying that the major impetus for its diplomacy is to strengthen its defense apparatus. Biden commended Kishida on Wednesday for “standing strong” with the U.S. in upholding freedom of navigation in the South China Sea and maintaining peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait—both flashpoints for which China is the unstated but well-known aggressor. Read More: Why the U.S. Faces a Delicate Balancing Act on Countering China in the South China Sea Philippine President Marcos Jr., before departing for Washington, expressed a similar view of the new partnership being foremost about regional security: “The main intent of this trilateral agreement is for us to be able to continue to flourish, to be able to help one another, and of course, to keep the peace in the South China Sea and the freedom of navigation in the South China Sea,” he said . While increased cooperation has already boosted the military capabilities of the U.S. and its partners, as evidenced by a number of joint exercises in the region, experts warn that the lattice of “minilateral” relationships that the U.S. is weaving does not necessarily guarantee a system of mutual defense should conflict break out in the region. Read More: As U.S. and China Rivalry Heats Up, Each Side’s Asia Allies Ramp Up Military Spending “Despite growing ties, U.S. alliances in the Indo-Pacific do not have the level of institutionalization that they have with their NATO allies, such as command structures or plans for specific scenarios,” Kevin Chen, associate research fellow at RSIS, tells TIME. “There’s no guarantee for the Japanese to fight for the Filipinos, or the Australians to fight for the Filipinos,” says Stephen Nagy, senior fellow at the Asia Pacific Foundation of Canada. “It’s not going to happen.” The U.S.’s partnership-building effort could also backfire, if it appears too aggressive. China has repeatedly warned against a “ Cold War mentality ” that divides the world into rival blocs, though the U.S. maintains that it does not seek conflict with China. “States often go to war because they feel that they’re encircled, surrounded, and their survival is in jeopardy,” says Resnick. “So if China feels like it’s being rigged in by this increasingly strong sense of containment … it’s gonna get really upset and scared. That could just as easily trigger a war.” More Must-Reads From TIME The 100 Most Influential People of 2024 The Revolution of Yulia Navalnaya 6 Compliments That Land Every Time What's the Deal With the Bitcoin Halving?

The South Korean brand brought its home furnishings to market in Sweden for the first time with a brilliant debut at this year’s Stockholm Furniture Fair. Color, material, and form harmonized in a symphony of innovation layered with aesthetics to create a sense of immersion and emotional resonance for those walking the fair. “Drawing from the concept of ‘rollout,’ we envisioned our stand as a dynamic space where each product and designer could shine individually yet harmoniously,” shares Note Design Studio. Pieces were highlighted by striking, semi-transparent electric-green panels set against floor-to-ceiling brown craft paper that adorned the booth’s backdrop. And each part of the exhibit was easily assembled and disassembled in a commitment to versatility, accessibility, and material reuse. Having generated excitement and built up great anticipation, the melody echoes still. As the bridge serves to connect a verse to the song’s chorus, so too does Wekino With become a device for independent Korean designers to connect to a global market elevating what is expected of mass-produced goods. “This shift is poised to positively influence the trajectory of Korean design, transcending mere brand significance,” shares Wekino. “By demonstrating the capabilities of Korean design on an international stage, we believe our presence at the fair has not only contributed to the evolution of Korean design but also challenged conventional notions of Swedish design.” Wekino With draws from the juxtaposition of traditional and modern architecture in the bustling metropolis of Seoul, informing the fusion of vibrant textile design with unlikely forms that blur the line between form and function, utility and art. Objects like Bookworm fulfill a specific need while offering the possibility as a standalone object, in some ways arguing in favor of art’s functionality. Pieces like the Billow Lounge Chair and the Chroma mirror appear different at first glance, yet both share a bold use of shape and texture blending individual uniqueness and a shared modern aesthetic to produce a lively, cohesive collection. “The common thread between Swedish and Korean craft lies in their shared values of precision, simplicity, and respect for tradition,” continues Note Design Studio. “Both emphasize functionality, clean lines, and natural materials, showcasing a blend of tradition and modernity. Whether it’s Swedish minimalism or Korean elegance, both traditions prioritize craftsmanship and quality, resulting in timeless and beautiful creations.” WEKINO \\\ Billow Lounge WEKINO is a Korean lifestyle brand that imbues their home furnishings with the dynamism of Seoul, South Korea. The designers behind their products consider the way form, space, and color can impact daily life to propose objects perfect for personal curation. The Billow Lounge takes cues from the clouds. With its dense cushions, curvaceous upholstery, and thin, linear structure, this chair appears to float through space as it rests atop its base. Wekino design team Studio PESI \\\ Stout Collection Possibility, essential, standpoint, and interpretation. These are the things that define Studio PESI. This industrial design studio, founded by Byounghwi Jeon in 2015, aims to create emotive experiences with his works through simplicity, functionality, and rationality. The Stout Collection comprises dining chairs and armchairs constructed from powder-coated tubular steel. The curved components strike a delightful balance between materiality and form. Byounghwi Jeon of Studio PESI Studio Kunsik \\\ Salong Table Helmed by Kunsik Choi, his eponymous studio tackles furniture, objects, and spacemaking. Based out of Stockholm, Sweden, the maker explores the power and intimacy of handmade design with works that toe the line of art and design. The Salong Table is created with the motif of the “Sculptor’s Atelier” with the intention of making a home in public or private spaces. The octagonal wooden legs provide a visual weight and stability that makes it feel ideal for a variety of functions. Kunsik Choi of Studio Kunsik Kwangho Lee \\\ Pirouette Living and working out of Seoul, designer Kwangho Lee elevates everyday objects to a place where ordinary things spark joy. And in some cases, discovers new ways that materials can come together in the name of fun. Pirouette is based on a prototype Lee crafted in partnership with Phaidon Press. It is now reimagined as a shelving collection for Wekino in two- and three-tier options. As its name suggests, this shelving unit is flexible and multifunctional. Kwangho Lee KUO DUO \\\ Reel Hanger & Book Worm KUO DUO is a studio formed by Kwachan Lee and Yoomin Maeng who work in exciting three-dimensional designs for furniture, products, and installations. From experimental one-off projects to the mass-produced, the duo delivers expressive creations that expand adventure wherever they land. The Reel Hanger is a coat rack with an aluminum body and sand-casted surface celebrating the tactility or something often overlooked. Book Worm is a fluid, organic line whose shape allows for both utility and sculpture. Hwachan Lee and Yoomin Maeng of KUO DUO Studio Word \\\ Oddly Established by Kyuhyung Cho and Jungyou Choi in 2018, the pair travels between South Korea and Europe as they work in the fields of graphic, product, furniture, and spatial design. Their works speak a unique visual language bridging tradition with modernity. The Oddly rug is inspired by a Joseon-era painting that emulates amorphous rock shapes. It boasts a three-dimensional pile in its sweeping curves, cool color combinations, and irregular patterns. The Oddly rug by Studio Word showcased at Wekino’s exhibit in the 2024 Stockholm Furniture Fair as designed by Note Studio The richly tactile Oddly rug. Kyuhyung Cho and Jungyou Choi of Studio Word Studio-Chacha \\\ Chroma Cha Shin-sil leads the Seoul-based design practice Studio-Chacha working in fine art and furniture with a focus on combining familiar materials in unfamiliar ways. The creative is currently discovering new material properties unlocked through an exploration of gradient and transparency. Chroma is both an art object and functional mirror. Inspired by a patchwork of wrapping cloth, this piece fuses traditional Korean craftwork with contemporary execution and sensibility in search of the exciting.

MLB's 2024 Opening Day Pitching Matchups Announced for All 15 Games | News, Scores, Highlights, Stats, and Rumors | Bleacher Report X Bleacher Report MLB NEWS SCORES TEAMS RUMORS HIGHLIGHTS FANTASY DRAFT BR Sports on Max Bleacher Report NBA WORLD FOOTBALL NFL AEW WWE MMA BOXING SPORTS SCORES Account MLB NEWS SCORES TEAMS RUMORS HIGHLIGHTS FANTASY DRAFT BR Sports on Max Facebook Logo Copy Link Icon Home > MLB MLB's 2024 Opening Day Pitching Matchups Announced for All 15 Games Joseph Zucker @ @JosephZucker Featured Columnist IV March 19, 2024 Comments Comment Bubble Icon Masterpress/Getty Images MLB announced Tuesday the full slate of starting pitchers for Opening Day. The season officially gets underway Wednesday in Seoul, South Korea. Yu Darvish takes the bump for the San Diego Padres, while Tyler Glasnow will make his Los Angeles Dodgers debut. The season more widely unfolds on March 28. Mark Feinsand @ Feinsand All 15 <a href="https://twitter.com/MLB?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@MLB</a> Opening Day pitching matchups have been announced: <a href="https://t.co/JXGTapgkgE">pic.twitter.com/JXGTapgkgE</a> Glasnow won't be the only notable new face in a new place for the first game of the 2024 season. Baltimore Orioles fans won't have to wait long to see Corbin Burnes, as he'll oppose the Los Angeles Angels' Patrick Sandoval. For much of the offseason, the fanbase might have been left underwhelmed by the lack of movement in Baltimore on the heels of a 101-win campaign. Acquiring Burnes was a big boost for the Orioles as they look to build on that success. The most engaging battle on Opening Day will unfold at Citizens Bank Park in Philadelphia. The Atlanta Braves' Spencer Strider and Philadelphia Phillies' Zack Wheeler finished fourth and sixth, respectively, in the National League Cy Young voting. Strider won 20 games and led MLB with 281 strikeouts across 186.2 innings. Wheeler posted a 3.15 FIP and fanned his second-most batters (212) ever. Atlanta vs. Philly has all the makings of a pitchers' duel, at least for as long as the two starters are allowed to stay on the mound. While fans have come to expect Opening Day to be a showcase of aces, several major stars will be absent for one reason or another. Shohei Ohtani is unlikely to throw at all in his first year with the Los Angeles Dodgers. The New York Yankees' Gerrit Cole, Tampa Bay Rays' Shane McClanahan, Miami Marlins' Sandy Alcantara, Houston Astros' Justin Verlander and the Texas Rangers' Max Scherzer and Jacob deGrom are all on the injured list. Reigning NL Cy Young winner Blake Snell won't be in contention, either, after having not agreed to a deal until Monday.

Created by Molly White . Subscribe to her newsletter for weekly recaps. Twitter Mastodon Bluesky Instagram Threads Start from the top April 5, 2024 Do Kwon and Terraform Labs found liable for $40 billion fraud Do Kwon (attribution) After hearing arguments that Terraform Labs was "built on lies" during a two-week-long trial, the jury in the civil case against the company and its founder Do Kwon found that both were liable for fraud. Kwon and his company were behind the algorithmic stablecoin, Terra, which dramatically collapsed in May 2022, sending huge ripple effects throughout the ecosystem. He and his company had lied about the stability of the token, ultimately causing massive financial damage to the tune of around $40 billion. Kwon is in custody in Montenegro after attempting to flee criminal cases in both the United States and South Korea. The civil case in the US proceeded without him.

[archive] Theme tags: Law Blockchain tags: Blockchain: Terra April 4, 2024 SushiSwap team votes to give themselves control of much of the "decentralized" project's treasury (attribution) The leadership team behind SushiSwap, a popular defi platform, submitted proposals for a DAO governance vote that would transfer control of around $40 million from the DAO to a small centralized organization called "Sushi Labs". That organization would also receive all future airdrops awarded to SushiSwap. According to the proposal, this was motivated by a desire for efficiency and faster development. The "yes" votes are currently in the lead with a 63% margin. The most yes votes came from sushigov.eth, the official SushiSwap team address, which also created the proposal. It is the first time that address has ever participated in a governance proposal. The 5.5 million yes votes from the team wallet, plus another 3.1 million delegated from other community members, were enough to push the vote to majority support. A former SushiSwap contributor has also alleged that the SushiSwap team was manipulating the vote with additional wallets. On Twitter, Sushi's "Head Chef" claimed that he had consulted with lawyers and then authorized the voting activity out of fear of an "extortative [sic] governance attack attempt".

Despite that, people sent the creator over 8.8 ETH (almost $29,000) for the project's "pre-sale", even as they repeated on Twitter that the project was a scam and that no one should buy it. Theme tags: Rug pull Blockchain tags: Blockchain: Ethereum April 1, 2024 FixedFloat exchange hacked again (attribution) The FixedFloat cryptocurrency exchange was exploited again, this time for around $2.8 million. This follows shortly after a February 18 hack in which attackers made off with $26 million. FixedFloat acknowledged the theft in a Twitter post, and blamed the same thieves. They claimed that this theft was enabled by a vulnerability in a third-party service.

A cause has yet to be definitively determined, but some of the thefts were linked to the use of trading bots like Solareum. Solareum speculated that the exploits may have been linked to compromised Telegram bot tokens, which could have allowed the attackers to obtain private keys from message history. Solareum later wrote that they would be closing the project, and deleted their website. This drew some criticism from users who accused them of doing nothing to investigate the hack, or even being responsible themselves. The project wrote on Twitter, "We at #SOLAREUM team can clarify that we DO NOT steal money." Ah, well, in that case. Other bots may have been involved in the theft, though it's not clear at this point. Though there was some speculation that a trading bot called BonkBot was to blame, that seems to have been unfounded. The total theft amount is not clear, but exceeds $500,000.

An attacker was able to take advantage of a flaw in the project's smart contracts , allowing them to manipulate users' positions and steal some of their collateral. Two other watchful attackers observed the attack strategy and replicated it, stealing a combined additional 173 ETH (~$610,000). Plasma paused the protocol after detecting the attack. The first attacker, who stole the bulk of the assets, sent an on-chain message to Prisma claiming that they had performed a "whitehat rescue", and inquired about returning the funds. In later messages, however, they asked the project to answer questions about their security practices and projects' responsibilities to users to prevent attacks. The attacker then transferred the stolen funds to Tornado Cash — indicating their return is unlikely. In another message, the attacker was angry that Prisma had not expressed gratitude to them or remorse to their users, and was angry they had used terms like "exploit" and "attack" in their description of the incident. They demanded that the team reveal their identities, apologize, and thank the attacker in an online press conference.

One of the co-founders, known only as "Paul", claimed on Discord that he was "trying to investigate" the movement of funds, which have been blamed on the project's other co-founder, John Kim. Conversations on Discord suggest that a remaining $3 million in treasury funds were protected, and that the remaining LENX team may have been able to convince Binance to freeze the account that received stolen funds. However, little has been verifiably confirmed to date. LENX is backed by the Frax Finance lending protocol.

Both founders are Chinese citizens, and neither has been located or arrested. According to prosecutors, they tried to conceal that the exchange had customers from the United States in order to claim that they were exempt from US anti-money laundering laws. They also marketed KuCoin as a KYC -optional exchange where customers from the US could operate unverified accounts. The charges against the founders carry maximum sentences of five years in prison.

Each realm has their own unique and distinctive schniblet, and the Munchables react differently based on their compatibility to the schniblets fed to them. When creating an account for the Munchables, you must choose the location of your snuggery." Right then. Things went awry in the land of the schnibbles and snuggeries when an attacker siphoned around 17,400 ETH ($62.5 million). Various descriptions of the attack circulated, with blockchain sleuth zachxbt attributing it to a recently hired developer, and crypto developer 0xQuit claiming the theft appeared to have been "planned since deploy". Some began discussing the possibility that the Blast layer-2 blockchain might forcibly roll back the chain to "undo" the hack. Some have argued this is contra to the crypto ethos or would set a bad precedent, while others have argued that as a blockchain focused more on gaming and experimentation and less on decentralization and other facets of crypto ideology, it would be a reasonable step. Some hours after the attack, the exploiter was convinced to return the funds.

Here’s what’s new By Bryan M. Wolfe March 26, 2024 Share Andy Boxall / Digital Trends Samsung Galaxy S24 owners just received some great news. Samsung recently released an April software update that addresses various camera issues. Unfortunately, this update is only available in South Korea, but according to information posted on the Samsung Korea forum , it is expected to be released in other regions soon. Firmware version S928NKSU1AXCA is almost 800MB in size. It includes improvements for lowlight images and image colors in Samsung’s Expert RAW app, improved text clarity when zooming in photo mode, and support for 480 x 480 resolution when recording Instant Slow-Mo videos. The Galaxy S24 update for April builds on the improvements from the previous February release, which included enhanced zoom, portrait mode, night mode, and rear camera video capture capabilities. Recommended Videos Samsung launched its latest flagship phone lineup earlier this year. It consists of two standard models, the Galaxy S24 and Galaxy S24 Plus , and the top-of-the-line Galaxy S24 Ultra . They are among our favorite phones of the year.

Although this latest update from Samsung doesn’t revolutionize the S24’s camera system, any improvements are always good to see.

It offers the latest and greatest from Apple, including the new A17 Pro chip, a fantastic camera system, a lightweight titanium body, the Action button, and USB-C charging. It's a great package. But there’s no doubt about it — the iPhone 15 Pro Max is also quite expensive, with a starting price of $1,200.

Campaigners for the conservative People Power Party attend a rally in Seoul [Anthony Wallace/AFP] Published On 9 Apr 2024 9 Apr 2024 South Koreans will head to the polls on Wednesday to choose who will sit in the country’s 300-member parliament in a major political test of conservative President Yoon Suk-yeol. Yoon was elected leader two years ago with the slimmest margin of victory in any presidential election, defeating Lee Jae-myung of the Democratic Party by 0.73 percent. Keep reading list of 4 items list 1 of 4 South Korea puts second military spy satellite successfully into orbit list 2 of 4 North Korea fires suspected intermediate-range ballistic missile list 3 of 4 South Korea’s Yoon accuses doctors of running ‘cartel’ as strike drags on list 4 of 4 South Korean bus drivers return to work after strike causes rush-hour chaos end of list His approval ratings remain low amid an acrimonious doctors’ strike, rising food prices and allegations of corruption, which could spell trouble for his People Power Party. But the Democratic Party is not much more popular, with Lee facing corruption charges . The National Assembly, as the parliament is known, is currently controlled by the Democrats, and whoever wins the April 10 vote will be in a position to set the tone for domestic politics over its next four-year term. Here is all you need to know about the elections: Why does the election matter? The election comes with Yoon enduring months of low approval ratings, and can be seen as a “half-term assessment” of his administration, according to the US-based Stimson Center. If the PPP performs poorly or is unable to claim a majority in parliament the president is likely to lose further momentum in his final three years in office. South Korean presidents serve only a single term. “With the opposition-led parliament, it has been hard to make a policy push or achievement over the last two years. Without change during the rest of his term, it would be extremely hard to do his job,” said Lee Jun-han, professor of political science at Incheon National University. The election is being seen as a referendum on conservative President Yoon Suk-yeol [Yonhap via Reuters] Whatever the outcome, the election is unlikely to have much of an effect on the country’s foreign policy, however. Yoon has sought to deepen its political and military ties with Japan and the United States amid bellicose talk from Pyongyang, which has been testing new weaponry and developing closer relations with Russia. What are the main parties? The PPP and Democratic Party have dominated South Korean politics for years. As of March 2024, the National Assembly had 297 members out of a total of 300 seats. The DP held the most seats with 160, followed by the PPP with 113. There are also a number of smaller parties, some of them set up by breakaway factions of the established parties. More than 20 percent of voters said they would vote for the newly-launched Reform Korea party under former justice minister Cho Kuk via the proportional representation vote, according to a Gallup poll released on March 29. That could give the party between 10 and 15 seats, and perhaps make them a kingmaker in the new parliament. Democratic Party campaigners perform a dance routine for the crowd at a rally earlier this week [Kim Hong-Ji/Reuters] What are the key issues? Opinion polls suggest the cost of living and rising food prices are key issues for voters. Yoon and his party felt the heat after a visit to a supermarket last month when he tried to promote government efforts to tame prices by talking about the price of green onions. Looking at a bundle of onions with a price tag of 875 won ($0.65) – a discounted price as a result of a government subsidy – Yoon said he thought the price was “reasonable”. The comment gave plenty of fodder to the opposition – the average retail price for green onions has been hovering between 3,000 won and 4,000 won ($2.20 to $2.90) – with candidates for the Democratic Party brandishing onions at campaign rallies and accusing Yoon of being out of touch. It is not just onions that have surged in price, either. Prices of agricultural products increased by more than 20 percent in March from the same month last year. The price of apples surged nearly 90 percent, marking the largest one-year jump since 1980. Onions have emerged as an unlikely issue in the election, amid rising frustration over the government’s handling of the economy [File: Kim Daewoung/Reuters] Voters are also concerned about a weeks-long strike by thousands of doctors angry over plans to reform medical education, which has forced operations to be cancelled and increased waiting times. Yoon has refused to budge, but opinion polls suggest increasing public support for a compromise to end the dispute. Corruption also remains a major issue. Yoon is under pressure over the so-called “Dior bag scandal” after footage surfaced last November showing his wife accepting a $2,200 designer handbag. Yoon has dismissed the video as a “political scheme” but such a gift would breach South Korean law banning public officials and their spouses from accepting anything worth more than $750. He is also facing the heat over his decision to appoint former defence minister Lee Jong-sup as the country’s ambassador to Australia while being under investigation for corruption. Lee resigned on March 29 less than a month after an outcry, not only among the opposition but also within the PPP. The Democratic Party also has its own struggles with corruption. Leader Lee is facing trial over charges including bribery. Cho also has baggage. A rising political star during the government of Yoon’s Democratic predecessor, Moon Jae-in, he faced a slew of scandals that undermined his reformist image and sharply split the nation. In February, a court sentenced him to two years in prison for forging documents for his children’s university admission, and he has one last appeal. And what will not be an issue? North Korea . Despite all its weapons tests and moves to end all forms of cooperation with South Korea, most voters are inured to the rumblings from across the border. The “widespread public feeling towards North Korea is pity, not fear,” political consultant Bae Kang-hun told the AFP news agency, noting the South Korean economy is about 40 times larger than North Korea’s. Turnout for early voting was high, suggesting strong interest in Wednesday’s poll [Kim Soo-hyeon/Reuters] How does the election work? Polling stations open at 6am (21:00 GMT) across the country and close 12 hours later. Thousands queued for early voting on Friday and Saturday, suggesting turnout could be high on Wednesday. There are some 44 million voters. South Korea uses a mixed-member system of proportional representation, which was introduced in 2020. Under this system, voters cast two ballots: one for their local district (254 seats) and another for a political party. The proportion of votes received by each party is used to allocate the 46 remaining seats, and is meant to ensure better representation for smaller parties. Although there is a stark political divide between the conservatives and liberals, experts say between 30 and 40 percent of voters could be undecided. Even if conservatives and liberals intensely bicker over political issues, that won’t influence election results much, Choi Jin, director of the Seoul-based Institute of Presidential Leadership told the Associated Press news agency. “The fate of an election is rather determined by the moderates who silently monitor livelihood issues and decide who to vote for.” Source : Al Jazeera and news agencies aj-logo aj-logo aj-logo About Show more About Us Code of Ethics Terms and Conditions EU/EEA Regulatory Notice Privacy Policy Cookie Policy Cookie Preferences Sitemap Work for us HR Quality Connect Show more Contact Us User Accounts Help Advertise with us Apps Newsletters Channel Finder TV Schedule Podcasts Submit a Tip Our Channels Show more Al Jazeera Arabic Al Jazeera English Al Jazeera Investigative Unit Al Jazeera Mubasher Al Jazeera Documentary Al Jazeera Balkans AJ+ Our Network Show more Al Jazeera Centre for Studies Al Jazeera Media Institute Learn Arabic Al Jazeera Centre for Public Liberties & Human Rights Al Jazeera Forum Al Jazeera Hotel Partners Follow Al Jazeera English: facebook twitter youtube instagram-colored-outline rss © 2024 Al Jazeera Media Network

South Korea's second military spy satellite lifts off from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida [South Korea Defence Ministry via AP] Published On 8 Apr 2024 8 Apr 2024 South Korea has successfully launched its second military reconnaissance satellite, days after North Korea reiterated its intention to launch multiple spy satellites this year. The satellite entered orbit after its launch on a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket from the John F Kennedy Space Center in Florida in the United States on Sunday, South Korea’s National Ministry of Defense said. Keep reading list of 4 items list 1 of 4 North Korea fires suspected intermediate-range ballistic missile list 2 of 4 South Korea’s Yoon accuses doctors of running ‘cartel’ as strike drags on list 3 of 4 South Korean bus drivers return to work after strike causes rush-hour chaos list 4 of 4 South Korean footballer Son Jun-ho released by China after 10 months end of list Seoul’s military said in a statement that its “independent intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance capabilities have been further strengthened” by the successful launch. “We will proceed with future satellite launches without a hitch,” it added. The Falcon 9 rocket was launched at 23:17 GMT and the satellite successfully separated from the launch vehicle 45 minutes later and entered its targeted orbit, according to the statement. It made successful communications with a ground station about two hours and 40 minutes after the launch, the ministry added. South Korea, which plans to launch a total of five military spy satellites by 2025, is in a race with North Korea to expand its surveillance capabilities amid rising tension on the Korean Peninsula. Pyongyang launched its first spy satellite – Malligyong-1 – in November last year in its third attempt , while South Korea put its satellite into orbit the following month. North Korea has since said its satellite had transmitted imagery of key sites in the US, including the White House and the Pentagon, but has not released any of the photos. On March 31, Pak Kyong Su, the vice general director of North Korea’s National Aerospace Technology Administration, said the country expected to launch several more reconnaissance satellites this year. Leader Kim Jong Un has previously said he aimed to put three more military spy satellites into space in 2024. South Korean Defence Minister Shin Wonsik said on Monday that the first of those launches could take place as soon as next week – to mark the April 15 birthday of state founder Kim Il Sung. The holiday, known as the Day of the Sun , is typically marked with mass ceremonies and military parades. North Korean satellite launches are seen as a violation of United Nations sanctions imposed on Pyongyang over its nuclear weapons programme because they make use of banned ballistic missile technology.

Stocks slide on Middle East tensions as hope crisis contained stems losses | Financial Markets | Al Jazeera Skip links Skip to Content play Live Show navigation menu Navigation menu News Show more news sections Middle East Africa Asia US & Canada Latin America Europe Asia Pacific Israel War on Gaza Features Opinion Video More Show more sections Economy Ukraine war Coronavirus Climate Crisis Investigations Interactives In Pictures Science & Technology Sport Podcasts play Live Click here to search search Economy | Financial Markets Stocks slide on Middle East tensions as hope crisis contained stems losses Stock markets in Australia, Japan, Hong Kong, Singapore and South Korea fall after Iran’s attack on Israel. Asian stock markets fell after Iran's drone and missile attacks on Israel [Kazuhiro Nogi/AFP] Published On 15 Apr 2024 15 Apr 2024 Stocks have tumbled in Asia after Iran ramped up Middle East tensions by launching a barrage of missiles and drones at Israel over the weekend, heightening fears of a wider conflict in the volatile region. However, while Israel called the attack – which Tehran said was in response to an earlier strike on its Syrian embassy – an escalation of hostilities, analysts said there was hope among traders that the crisis could be contained. Keep reading list of 4 items list 1 of 4 Iran claims ‘right to self-defence’ in Israel attack list 2 of 4 US military says it destroyed dozens of drones fired from Iran, Yemen list 3 of 4 ‘Obvious’ Sydney mall killer targeted women, Australian police say list 4 of 4 Manipur’s BJP CM inflamed conflict: Assam Rifles report on India violence end of list That sliver of optimism helped drag oil prices lower. Saturday’s bombardment of more than 300 ballistic and cruise missiles as well as attack drones – which were mostly repelled by air defences – compounded worries about the outlook for United States interest rates following more forecast-beating inflation and jobs data. Iran told the United Nations the strike was a “legitimate” defensive response to the attack in Damascus on April 1, which killed seven members of Tehran’s Revolutionary Guard, including two generals. It added on social media that “the matter can be deemed concluded” but warned that “should the Israeli regime make another mistake, Iran’s response will be considerably more severe”. Israeli military spokesman Daniel Hagari said it was “a severe and dangerous escalation”. But experts said the limited scope of the attack showed Iran was seeking to make a show of strength with its attack, without leading to a conflict. Meanwhile, US President Joe Biden was reported to have cautioned Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to “take the win” and forego a counterattack. Still, Saxo’s Redmond Wong said: “All eyes remain on whether there will be any response from Israel and markets will likely be volatile in the day ahead to any geopolitical headlines.” Asian markets mostly fell on Monday, though they pared their initial big losses. Tokyo, Singapore, Mumbai, Taipei and Manila were at least 1 percent down, while there were also losses in Hong Kong, Seoul, Sydney and Wellington. Shanghai rose by more than 1 percent after China on Friday unveiled new market regulatory measures, which one analyst said could help its long-term performance. US futures rose, having dropped sharply on Friday as investors went nervously into the weekend. “The muted market response likely stems from the highly intricate sentiment in the market at this stage,” said the IG Group’s Hebe Chen. “Market participants are certainly not giving up hope that the past weekend’s events were just a one-off occurrence, while holding their breath for what could happen next.” With worries about an escalation subsiding for now, oil prices dipped, though observers warned they could spike back above $100 if the crisis worsens. “This war may move down the escalation ladder if the Israeli government follows the advice of the White House and forgoes retaliatory action,” said Helima Croft at RBC Capital Markets. The broadly risk-off mood sent the US dollar up against its major peers while dimming hopes for US interest rate cuts helped it push to a new 34-year high against the yen, putting Japanese officials in the spotlight after they said they were ready to step in to support their currency.

The US and China are trying to stabilise the two countries' relationship [Pedro Pardo/AFP] Published On 17 Apr 2024 17 Apr 2024 United States Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin and his Chinese counterpart Dong Jun have held their first substantive talks in nearly 18 months as the two countries work to restore military ties. The two spoke via videoconference on Tuesday, the Pentagon said in a statement. Keep reading list of 4 items list 1 of 4 Marcos Jr treads fine line with China as Philippines deepens US, Japan ties list 2 of 4 Summit with US, Japan aimed at economy, South China Sea cooperation: Marcos list 3 of 4 Russia and China to deepen security cooperation in Asia, Europe list 4 of 4 From unfair trade to TikTok: US Treasury Secretary Yellen’s China trip end of list It said Austin “underscored the importance of respect for high seas freedom of navigation guaranteed under international law, especially in the South China Sea”. An escalating diplomatic dispute and recent incidents between China and the Philippines , a US treaty ally, at a disputed shoal have turned the strategically significant South China Sea into a potential flashpoint between Washington and Beijing. China claims the sea almost in its entirety while Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines and Vietnam claim the areas around their coasts. An international court ruled in 2016 that China’s nine-dash line , on which Beijing bases its claim, was without merit. “The US side should recognise China’s firm position, respect China’s territorial sovereignty and maritime rights and interests in the South China Sea, and take practical actions to safeguard regional peace,” Dong was quoted as saying in a statement by China’s Ministry of Defence. He also warned the US over the democratic island of Taiwan, which Beijing claims as its own, emphasising it was the “core of China’s core interests”. Austin’s last significant interaction with China’s defence minister was in November 2022 when he met Wei Fenghe in Cambodia. Wei was subsequently replaced by Li Shangfu, who shook hands and spoke briefly with Austin at a security conference in Singapore last June, but steered clear of a formal meeting. Li, who was under US sanctions, disappeared from view shortly afterwards and was fired in October. Dong was appointed in December. Ways to ‘get along’ The US and China have been working to improve a relationship that had become increasingly acrimonious over issues from Taiwan to the South China Sea, as well as trade and human rights. US President Joe Biden met Chinese President Xi Jinping in California last November where they agreed to stabilise the relationship and resume military ties which had been frozen as a result of then-US House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s visit to Taiwan. The US’s top military general later held discussions with his Chinese counterpart and this month, US and Chinese military officials met in Hawaii to discuss ways the two countries could operate safely. China and the US should explore ways to “get along” and “gradually accumulate mutual trust” by building a “non-conflict, non-confrontation”, pragmatic and cooperative relationship between their militaries, Dong was quoted as saying on his call with Austin. “The military sphere is the key… to stabilising the development of the relationship and preventing major crises from occurring,” he said. Austin also stressed the need to maintain open lines of communication to reduce the risk of potential flare-ups or deal with any accidents. “Secretary Austin emphasized the importance of continuing to open lines of military-to-military communication between the United States and the PRC,” the Pentagon said, using an acronym for the People’s Republic of China.

Fantasy Baseball 2024: Sleepers, Busts and Final MLB Mock Draft | News, Scores, Highlights, Stats, and Rumors | Bleacher Report Bleacher Report MLB NEWS SCORES TEAMS RUMORS HIGHLIGHTS FANTASY DRAFT BR Sports on Max Bleacher Report NBA WORLD FOOTBALL NFL AEW WWE MMA BOXING SPORTS SCORES Account MLB NEWS SCORES TEAMS RUMORS HIGHLIGHTS FANTASY DRAFT BR Sports on Max Facebook Logo Copy Link Icon Home > MLB Fantasy Baseball 2024: Sleepers, Busts and Final MLB Mock Draft Zach Buckley @ @ZachBuckleyNBA Featured Columnist IV March 23, 2024 Comments Comment Bubble Icon Fantasy Baseball 2024: Sleepers, Busts and Final MLB Mock Draft 0 of 3 David Durochik/Diamond Images via Getty Images Think of the two-game set played between the San Diego Padres and Los Angeles Dodgers in Seoul, South Korea as the soft opening of the 2024 MLB season. This coming Thursday, then, is the official grand opening of the campaign as all 30 teams will be in action, 28 of them for the first time. For fantasy baseball managers, that means it's go time. This should be the busiest fantasy baseball draft weekend of the year, so let's make sure you're fully prepared for it by running through a two-round mock draft and highlighting a couple of sleepers to target and busts to avoid. Two-Round, 12-Team Points Mock Draft 1 of 3 Mary DeCicco/MLB Photos via Getty Images Round 1 1. Ronald Acuña Jr., OF, Atlanta Braves 2. Mookie Betts, 2B/OF, Los Angeles Dodgers\ 3. Spencer Strider, SP, Atlanta Braves 4. Juan Soto, OF, New York Yankees 5. Freddie Freeman, 1B, Los Angeles Dodgers 6. Kyle Tucker, OF, Houston Astros 7. José Ramírez, 3B, Cleveland Guardians 8. Shohei Ohtani, DH, Los Angeles Dodgers 9. Matt Olson, 1B, Atlanta Braves 10. Aaron Judge, OF, New York Yankees 11. Corbin Burnes, SP, Baltimore Orioles 12. Yordan Álvarez, OF, Houston Astros Round 2 13. Zack Wheeler, SP, Philadelphia Phillies 13. Corbin Carroll, OF, Arizona Diamondbacks 14. Bobby Witt Jr., SS, Kansas City Royals 15. Julio Rodríguez, OF, Seattle Mariners 16. Luis Castillo, SP, Seattle Mariners 17. Vladimir Guerrero Jr., 1B, Toronto Blue Jays 18. Marcus Semien, 2B, Texas Rangers 19. Rafael Devers, 3B, Boston Red Sox 20. Fernando Tatis Jr., OF, San Diego Padres 21. Pablo López, SP, Minnesota Twins 22. Logan Webb, SP, San Francisco Giants 23. Ozzie Albies, 2B, Atlanta Braves 24. Corey Seager, SS, Texas Rangers Sleepers 2 of 3 Masterpress/Getty Images Michael King, SP/RP, San Diego Padres King was all-caps AWESOME last season, and while he spent a big chunk of it in a relief role, he was equally effective as a starter. In fact, he was even sharper when given a chance to spread his wings, as his nine starts produced a 2.23 ERA, a 1.14 WHIP and 51 strikeouts against only nine walks in 40.1 innings. There are some risks involved, as his injury history isn't the cleanest, and the 104.2 innings he threw last season were (easily) a career-high. Still, the reward is truly spectacular, as his upside is nothing short of being one of baseball's best pitchers—again. Lourdes Gurriel Jr., OF, Arizona Diamondbacks Sleepers don't always have to be players perceived to have untapped potential. Anyone being undervalued can qualify, meaning the proven, "boring" types can still qualify, so long as the fantasy community isn't giving them their proper due. That's the sleeper case in a nutshell for Gurriel, whose consensus average draft position sits outside of the top 200 , per FantasyPros. That's really good value for someone who's tallied better than 20 homers and 80 RBI in two of the past three seasons. It wouldn't be shocking to see his bat level-up into 30-homer territory, and his run production has some upward mobility in this ascending Arizona offense. Busts 3 of 3 Rich Storry/Getty Images Jazz Chisholm Jr., OF, Miami Marlins Chisholm admittedly tantalizes, and if this is the year where everything goes right, he could be phenomenal. But his stat sheet shows more absences than anything, as his career games count is only up to 302 despite the fact he debuted in 2020. If you could bank on 140-plus games for him, he'd be the kind of power-speed contributor (19 homers and 22 steals in 97 games last season) you could build a fantasy lineup around. But you can't even say for certain he'll be on the field for 100 games, so his consensus ADP of 41 isn't enough of a discount for the injury risks he presents. Blake Snell, SP, San Francisco Giants The idea of getting the reigning NL Cy Young winner outside of the top 100—Snell's consensus ADP is 106 —sounds borderline bust-proof, doesn't it? Well, if said Cy Young winner was anyone other than Snell, it might be. With him, though, a career's worth of consistent inconsistency and availability issues makes even this draft cost an elevated price. The first time he won a Cy Young, he followed up by pitching to a 6-8 record with a 4.29 ERA and 40 walks in just 107 innings. Last season was only the 31-year-old's second with 130-plus innings, and he wasn't as sharp as that hardware suggests, as he had a huge gap between his actual ERA (2.25) and his expected ERA ( 3.77 , per StatCast) and led the NL 99 walks.

Today's top stories Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant is in Washington today to meet with U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and other senior officials. Gallant said he will discuss U.S. military aid. But some Democrats say Israel's actions may disqualify it from aid . Gallant's visit comes at a time of increasing tensions between the two allies about the next steps in the war and reducing civilian suffering in Gaza.

A report out this week shows widespread hunger and malnutrition in Gaza but stopped short of declaring it a "famine." Abed Rahim Khatib/Anadolu via Getty Images NPR's Jennifer Ludden brings the latest developments for Up First from Tel Aviv, reporting that Israel has been battling Hamas militants they claim have regrouped at al-Shifa hospital. Thousands of doctors, patients and civilians sheltering there have been caught in the fighting. Amber Alayyan, an American physician with Doctors Without Borders, says the surviving patients are "literally rotting ." Meanwhile, U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres repeated his call for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire in Gaza, calling the starvation there a "moral outrage" on his visit to the border crossing between Egypt and Gaza. Who decides the definition of a famine? An international committee said last week that 30% of Gaza's population is currently experiencing "catastrophic" levels of hunger. Here's what to know about what it takes to declare a famine , according to two experts who work with government officials and aid workers globally. Russia says it has arrested four men and charged them with terrorism in connection to an attack at a Russian concert hall in Moscow that killed more than 130 people last week. An affiliate of the Islamic State known as ISIS-K has claimed responsibility — a claim the U.S. agrees with. Russian President Vladimir Putin insists the assailants were captured while trying to flee to Ukraine. "It seems the government is intent on channeling this grief," says NPR's Charles Maynes, who attended a memorial outside of the site of the tragedy over the weekend. All four assailants pleaded guilty. But Maynes says some may question their confessions as all four showed signs of severe beatings. He adds that the question now will be what happens in the court of public opinion and on the battlefield in Ukraine. What is the Islamic State Khorasan Province, or ISIS-K? Here's what to know about one of the most militant jihadist groups in the world that often mounts attacks against other Islamist groups. Former President Donald Trump is facing two legal battles today in New York City. Today is his deadline to pay a $454 billion penalty for his civil fraud trial. Though he's appealed the decision, he's still required to set the money aside. New York Attorney General Letitia James says she is ready to seize Trump's properties if he's unable to make the payment. A criminal court judge will also hold a hearing today to set a trial date for Trump's hush money case. The former president is accused of falsifying business documents and making payments to adult film star Stormy Daniels prior to the 2016 election to cover up an alleged affair. Here's where all of Trump's legal cases currently stand .

While in Seoul, one chef is reinterpreting traditional Korean dishes, another kitchen in New York is leaning into the city's openness to new experiences and offering authentic Korean food that simply tastes good. South Korea's other cultural exports, like K-pop bands and TV series, have also increased Korean food's popularity — with support from its government.

X: Paris Marx / @parismarx : Gurman has long used his perch at Bloomberg to be an Apple booster, but it's wild how disingenuous his arguments are against the Apple antitrust suit.

They picked the wrong target for their outdated premise in the suit against Apple. They will regret it. 🚔 Evan Zimmerman / @ejzim : You should subscribe to Mark's newsletter.

Patrick Moorhead / @patrickmoorhead : Good piece.  I think DoJ went after iPhone as monopoly because of the prior App Store lawsuits that didn't result in much, so it had to take a different tack.  Also, after what Apple pulled with DMA and what some call suspect compliance, it was the straw that broke the camels back... What I wish you would have pointed out that on Windows, Apple offers an iCloud app that syncs files, bookmarks, email, calendars and more.  If Apple can secure all your files on Windows, it can certainly secure iMessage on Android and Windows.  FWIW USG forced Microsoft to share its APIs with competitors, so there's precedence.

Great point on Windows and iCloud. I should have definitely mentioned. Nick Turner / @newsynick : A funny thing about the DOJ's case against Apple (as @markgurman notes here) is it hits hard on stuff that's a bit outdated or irrelevant and doesn't focus as much on what would seem like a major vulnerability: the App Store https://www.bloomberg.com/... [image] Michael Gartenberg / @gartenberg : I'm not sure that's going to matter because it all comes down to what some judge in NJ (who probably isn't super tech savvy and might own an iPhone and uses carplay).  Apple's attitude is going to matter.  I recall when Judge Penfield Jackson ordered Microsoft to create a version of Windows 95 without IE, which it promptly did, except the PC it ran on would not longer boot...

Steven Sinofsky / @stevesi : This is excellent.  One of the best things about getting to read Walt's opinions is knowing that over the years he's seen technology companies from every angle.  He's been critical of Apple.  He's applauded Apple.  He's been accused of being biased both for and against Apple at various times. … Benedict Evans / @benedictevans : The puzzle I have about the Apple ‘monopoly’ issue is not market definition or whether it has 50% or 75% US share. it's about choice.  In 1998 it was not realistic to tell someone 'if you don't like Windows, buy something else.' Buy what?  But it's absolutely realistic to say that about iPhones. 100m Americans bought an Android! … Ian Betteridge / @ianbetteridge : Back to market power.  Does Apple have it?  Well, Apple has certainly — publicly — said so.  Remember Apple very happily talking about the $1.1 trillion in developer billings and sales made through the App Store in 2022? … Ian Betteridge / @ianbetteridge : This was one of the new aspects of the Microsoft/DOJ case which, outside academic circles, didn't get noted much: it was the first major case which focused on the network effects where having monopoly power in one market could mean in other markets. … Ian Betteridge / @ianbetteridge : Walt is correct that the vertically integrated model has been Apple's since the start.  But what is permissible when you're a small company or in a nascent/developing market is no longer permissible when you are in a position of market power.  And no one doubts that Apple is in a position of significant market power, not the least Apple itself. @itslaurlyn : The government is out here after Apple for monopoly and like, I get it.  But their claims are honestly kind of weak.  (Hear me now, I don't give one iota about Apple, I just don't see the case here) Get tf after Ticketmaster though.  NOW THAT is a monopoly case. Robin Winters / @robin.winters.93 : If you want iPhone features, buy an iPhone!  It's like the government trying to force Taco Bell to carry Coke products because soooo many people eat there that it's anticompetitive if they only serve Pepsi products.  This reeks of grievance politics. Ian Betteridge / @ianbetteridge : Hmm, I don't know who I should trust when trying to work out how strong the DOJ's case is - tech pundits or actual professors of antitrust law?  It's so hard to decide. https://www.theverge.com/... Alan Graham / @agraham999 : Blocked.  The cult nonsense is lazy.  It's a terrible case that doesn't understand the core product Apple sells is not the device but the experience.  Let's lose the cult bs. Christopher Keelty / @christopherkeelty : BTW let's be clear: As Apple's market share has grown, their products have become worse.  Anyone arguing that the government is “stifling innovation” by going after Apple's anticompetitive trade practices is either drinking the iAid or not serious about the conversation.  The lack of competition is what has stifled innovation. Alan Graham / @agraham999 : BREAKING: DOJ claims Apple unfairly used Apple products inside of Apple TV+ Shows.  Claims bad guys use of Android devices in shows makes competing products look mean.  Probably. Jacob Peter Olness / @jolness : 1/ I've noticed 3 things since the apple antitrust suit was fired 1) people don't understand what antitrust is.  It doesn't require an absolute monopoly so “Apple doesn't sell every phone in the US” isn't a good argument. … Alan Graham / @agraham999 : BREAKING: Merrick Garland claims Apple Newton's market dominance responsible for the poor market reception of the Palm Pilot phone. Eli Johnson / @elimatthewjohnson : I'm a big fan of the iPhone, Apple and CarPlay and even I can see that this might be the best point the DOJ makes in the entire lawsuit.  Car companies should be able to use the current CarPlay setup, not be forced to choose between next-gen CarPlay or nothing at all. @ysamjo : I agree, it's absolutely wild what a institution like the DOJ considers good research (for a legal case!).  That they went public with this shows us that the gut feeling about Apple's practices has reached a tipping point. Alan Diggs / @schykle : There are a lot of opinions flying around on the whole US vs Apple thing but the very moment the US decides to impose some kind of restriction or interop that results in the experience being degraded in any way... then they've invalidated themselves ENTIRELY. … Alan Graham / @agraham999 : BREAKING: DOJ files complaint against Apple for developing its own Silicon processors, thus depriving Intel of revenue. B Floyd / @dalast1woke : The US DOJ isn't responsible for the world.  Its responsible for thr US.  But to say Apple markershare in the us is 50% when it's more like 65-70% ur Mischaracterizing the issue. Alex Cranz / @alexhcranz : reading many reactions to the Apple antitrust case I'm struck by how consistently Americans specifically balk at the core conceit of the case (and really antitrust law in general): that the government has an obligation to protect consumers. in the US we pride ourselves on individualism and we extend that pride to companies … @georgescriban : I'm old enough to remember when we called “super apps” a “walled garden.”  Think of AOL's or, more recently, Facebook's, efforts to be The One App Where You Did Everything—talk with friends, follow the news, do your shopping, watch movies, play games, book travel, pay your bills, etc. … Christopher Keelty / @christopherkeelty : I think what people miss here is that AOL, Facebook, etc are making software—or not even software.  Ultimately a web site like Facebook is literally just files.  Apple is making hardware, and that hardware locks you into software that you can only buy from their store.  These are entirely different business practices. Alex Cranz / @alexhcranz : I've seen this point brought up a few times, and I think there's a clear stance the government has in vertical integration: it's fine until it causes real harm to consumers.  Apple's business model was fine, from the DOJ's pov, until it started making texting Android users a functionally less secure … Michael Herf / @mherf : Disagree.  Say you're a developer who's spent 3 years making a new kind of game with a digital currency that gets it banned from the app store.  You're not going to start over on a “competing” platform with 5% share - porting is hard, and losing 70% of your market sucks - there is simply no replacement for a platform-level ecosystem. … Benedict Evans / @benedictevans : I think the problem with that hypothesis is that you probably shouldn't have spent three years building something that you knew at the outset was against Apple rules if you were relying on that.  Plus, epic built a really great business with a game that used virtual currency on the App Store -it just decided it didn't like paying Apple. Walt Mossberg / @mossbergwalt : 3/ Calling Apple a “monopoly” in phones is laughable.  Every independent analyst estimates iPhone market share at a little over 50% in the US and a little under 25% globally.  That's not a monopoly.  The DOJ has had to invent a new way of measuring a market, “performance” phones, meaning expensive phones. … Jordan Dea-Mattson / @jdeamattson : Years ago, when I was at Apple, and Apple was honestly on the ropes, we were told by the world that we needed to adopt a business model that mirrored the rest of the world's.  First thing SJ did when he returned was to cancel Amelio's wrongly initiated licensing program and go even more integrated. 25 years later … Ian Betteridge / @ianbetteridge : All of this is going to trip plenty of people up.  How can a company have monopoly power when it doesn't have an 80%+ share of a market?  Why are we talking about third-party developers when Apple doesn't compete (much) against them?  Isn't Apple just trying to protect their customers? Ian Betteridge / @ianbetteridge : First up, if you do not respect Walt's opinions, you're a fool.  Walt is one of my tech journalism heroes.  That said, I think he's missing a couple of points here.  Long thread incoming. Walt Mossberg / @mossbergwalt : Thread.1/ Having covered tech for 27 years, and having just skimmed the actual text of the DOJ case against Apple, I have three big takeaways. Benedict Evans / @benedictevans : It still amazes me how sloppy this DoJ filing is.  It's Apple's fault that LG and HTC could not compete with Xiaomi, Oppo and Samsung?  Google Android phones are outsold by Samsung Android phones... because of iMessage?  WTF?  Ther's stuff like this on every page.  How did this get out of a drafting session?  Everyone at the DoJ should be professionally embarrassed. Walt Mossberg / @mossbergwalt : 2/ First and most importantly, the case essentially attacks Apple for being a vertically integrated smartphone manufacturer, melding every hardware component as well as native and permitted software and services.  Yet this has been Apple's core differentiator since the 1970's. … Mastodon: Alex Russell / @slightlyoff@toot.cafe : You know how I said there were going to be a LOT of bad takes?  —  The universe demands and, like clockwork, Sinofsky and Gruber provide.  It would take weeks to enumerate even the basic ways the VC/Monopolist apologist class are wrong on the facts...but this specific one is delicious. … Bluesky: Dennie Edwards / @dennieedwards.bsky.social : Apple is a nothing sandwich in comparison to the damage Google has wrought on the media and the internet.  The DOJ needs to focus on the real, far-reaching threat.  [embedded post] X: Jim Scardelis / @jimscard : Would love to hear @stevesi 's take on this. I was at Microsoft then, and I don't recall the DOJ settlement changing anything significant. Microsoft was already open about APIs and better than the detractors about providing SDKs and tools to developers for free/very low cost. Benjamin W. Slivka / @benslivka : A completely BIGUS claim: “Apple itself was a significant beneficiary of that case,” Jonathan Kanter, the Justice Department's assistant attorney general for antitrust, said this past week in announcing the new lawsuit. “The remedy paved the way for Apple to launch iTunes, the... Brad Silverberg / @bradsilverberg : @BenSlivka Completely factually incorrect. Msft begged Apple to do iTunes for Windows. It was totally an Apple decision to do or not do. Not something enabled by the antitrust suit. There is so much asserted about the results of the suit against msft that are just completely wrong. Steven Sinofsky / @stevesi : What is not being widely recognized is just how poorly put together (intentionally or not) the US v Apple complaint is.  It is vague and lacks foundation, which might be a tactic but also sloppy which I doubt was a tactic.  Much has been said about the false narratives on iTunes on Windows story, or Fire phone, or Super Apps... Steven Sinofsky / @stevesi : Patrick of course knows what I think and he knows the history.  The deal with Apple was a patent exchange because it was clear Apple was about to begin to use its portfolio as it had run out of options.  As far as patent deals go the 350M was a great deal, especially given the history of contractual/patent disputes... Jim Dalrymple / @jdalrymple : It is staggering how badly the DOJ doesn't understand tech. Johnny Mañana / @zenwave : @jdalrymple Next up for AG Garland: busting up Burger King's monopoly on the Whopper. Matt Stoller / @matthewstoller : One way you know it's wrong is because @stevesi misunderstands something I know a fair amount about - the antitrust bar. Most antitrust lawyers are *furious* at enforcers for expanding the bounds of the law. [image] Steven Sinofsky / @stevesi : @matthewstoller By definition what I said was true because there are some people (or even most as you claim) that are apparently upset at what is actually happening. [image] Matt Stoller / @matthewstoller : Silicon Valley monopolies exist today because the enforcement choices of the last 20 years. The antitrust bar, gov't enforcers, and tech execs have been partners for decades. It's why Sheryl Sandberg went from Treasury to Google to Facebook. Partners! Matt Stoller / @matthewstoller : @stevesi There's a religious belief among the management consulting/tech exec world that law just doesn't matter, it can't matter, that government and lawyers are irrelevant. These antitrust suits are a direct assault on that premise, on the Sorkin-esque view these men have of themselves. Matt Stoller / @matthewstoller : My favorite part of this error-filled essay by @stevesi is the self-pitying exhortation to Apple execs about how they should know they did nothing wrong, followed by a reminder not to put their crimes in email. Lotta emotion happening here! [image] Dare Obasanjo / @carnage4life : This excerpt from the DOJ's filing against Apple shows how Apple regularly uses privacy and security to justify anticompetitive moves but is quite happy to ignore them if it weakens their dominance. No encrypted chat between Android & iOS users in iMessage is an example. [image] Patrick Moorhead / @patrickmoorhead : Imagine if the USG hadn't intervened with Microsoft: -Apple wouldn't exist.  They'd be bankrupt.  Likely purchased by Oracle and Larry.  Or Dell or HP. iTunes would never have scaled which led to iPhone...We need a future world where developers are free to innovate, apps and app stores are free to compete in the open market, where companies in dominant positions don't control the next new things. Tero Kuittinen / @teroterotero : So these Yankees have rewritten the mobile phone industry history to be 100% North America focused - pretending Nokia simply did not exist & Microsoft would have dominated phone industry if iPhone hadn't debuted. Steven Sinofsky / @stevesi : 216. United States v. Apple (Complaint) - What does this case mean, putting it in some context, and looking at the big picture (plus includes the Twitter thread) by me in Hardcore Software https://open.substack.com/... Rich DeMuro / @richontech : I read all 88 pages of the Apple lawsuit so you don't have to, by @richontech https://open.substack.com/... Kontra / @counternotions : DOJ's antitrust suit against Apple may read infuriatingly ignorant, inaccurate and ahistorical, but, above all, it's an ideological frontal attack on the notion of integrated product/platform design...a death march to commodification and interchangeability.

The Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 Ultra could be out of our reach - Phandroid Search Menu News Reviews Deals How To Opinion More About Us Tip Us Privacy Policy Content Partnerships Online Sweepstakes VPN Search Devices Handsets News The Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 Ultra could be out of our reach By Tyler Lee April 1, 2024 0 We’ve been hearing rumors about Samsung potentially working on a cheaper version of the Galaxy Z Fold 6 . But it turns out that might not be all. Samsung could also be working on the other end of the spectrum for an even more expensive version of the phone. This is according to a report from Galaxy Club . According to the publication, the Galaxy Z Fold 6 Ultra is real. The bad news is that it might be exclusive to South Korea. This is based on the model number they uncovered, where the handset is apparently known as “SM-F958N”. The “8” in the model number is what is used to denote Samsung’s “Ultra” devices, like the Galaxy S24 Ultra which has the model number “SM-S928”. The “N” in the name means that it is a South Korean model. It is possible that Samsung could have other model numbers that have yet to be uncovered, but for now, it looks like it could be a South Korea exclusive. In a way it’s not necessarily a bad thing. Samsung’s foldables don’t come cheap and we’d hate to think how much an “Ultra” variant of the Galaxy Z Fold 6 could cost. Either way, it’s still too early to tell, but Samsung is rumored to be hosting a Galaxy Unpacked event this July , so we should have more details then.

Interpreter Ippei Mizuhara, 39, was let go from the team Wednesday following reports from the Los Angeles Times and ESPN about his alleged ties to an illegal bookmaker. The team is in Seoul, South Korea this week as Ohtani makes his Dodgers debut, and Mizuhara was in Los Angeles’ dugout during their season-opening win. “In the course of responding to recent media inquiries, we discovered that Shohei has been the victim of a massive theft and we are turning the matter over to the authorities,” law firm Berk Brettler LLP said in a statement Wednesday. Sports gambling is illegal in California, even as 38 states and the District of Columbia allow some form of it. Mizuhara is a familiar face to baseball fans as Ohtani’s constant companion, interpreting for him with the media and at other appearances since Ohtani came to the U.S. in 2017. He even served as Ohtani’s catcher during the Home Run Derby at the 2021 All-Star Game. When Ohtani left the Los Angeles Angels to sign a $700 million, 10-year contract with the Dodgers in December, the club also hired Mizuhara. The Dodgers said in a statement they were “aware of media reports and are gathering information. “The team can confirm that interpreter Ippei Mizuhara has been terminated,” the statement said. “The team has no further comment at this time.” On Tuesday, Mizuhara told ESPN that his bets were on international soccer, the NBA, the NFL and college football. MLB rules prohibit players and team employees from wagering—even legally—on baseball and also ban betting on other sports with illegal or offshore bookmakers. “I never bet on baseball,” Mizuhara told ESPN. “That’s 100%. I knew that rule ... We have a meeting about that in spring training.” The Associated Press could not immediately reach Mizuhara for comment Wednesday. Mizuhara was born in Japan and moved to the Los Angeles area in 1991 so his father could work as a chef. He attended Diamond Bar High School in eastern Los Angeles County and graduated from the University of California, Riverside, in 2007. After college, Mizuhara was hired by the Boston Red Sox as an interpreter for Japanese pitcher Hideki Okajima. In 2013, he returned to Japan to translate for English-speaking players on the Hokkaido Nippon-Ham Fighters. That’s where he first met Ohtani, who joined the team that same year. After Ohtani signed with the Angels in 2017, the team hired Mizuhara to work as his personal interpreter. ESPN said Mizuhara told the outlet this week he has been paid between $300,000 and $500,000 annually. ESPN said it spoke to Mizuhara on Tuesday night, at which point the interpreter said Ohtani had paid his gambling debts at Mizuhara’s request. After the statement from Ohtani’s attorneys saying the player was a victim of theft, ESPN says Mizuhara changed his story Wednesday and claimed Ohtani had no knowledge of the gambing debts and had not transferred any money to bookmakers. Mizuhara said he incurred more than $1 million in debt by the end of 2022 and his losses increased from there. “I’m terrible (at gambling). Never going to do it again. Never won any money,” Mizuhara said. “I mean, I dug myself a hole and it kept on getting bigger, and it meant I had to bet bigger to get out of it and just kept on losing. It’s like a snowball effect.” It would be the biggest gambling scandal for baseball since Pete Rose agreed to a lifetime ban in 1989 after an investigation for MLB by lawyer John Dowd found Rose placed numerous bets on the Cincinnati Reds to win from 1985-87 while playing for and managing the team. The MLB gambling policy, posted in every locker room, prohibit players and team employees from wagering—even legally—on baseball and also ban betting on other sports with illegal or offshore bookmakers. Betting on baseball is punishable with a one-year ban from the sport. The penalty for betting on other sports illegally is at the commissioner’s discretion. Ohtani’s stardom has spread worldwide, even as the two-way player has remained largely media-shy. The news of his recent marriage to Mamiko Tanaka shocked fans from Japan to the U.S. While he underwent surgery on his right elbow last September and will not pitch this season, he will be used as a designated hitter and there is a possibility he could play in the field. He went 2 for 5 with an RBI in his first game, the season opener against the San Diego Padres in Seoul, South Korea. —Blum reported from New York.

By John Duerden Asian football writer Last updated on 15 April 2024 15 April 2024 . From the section Football Jesse Lingard has played three times for FC Seoul, twice coming on as a substitute Jesse Lingard was never going to raise the international profile of South Korea's K-League to match K-Pop or K-Drama levels, and the former England international is struggling to make a positive impact in The Land of Morning Calm. With just 105 minutes played for FC Seoul in the first six games before undergoing knee surgery on Friday, Lingard has made more headlines for injuries and comments from his coach than for anything yet achieved on the pitch. Of course, these are still very early days. The former Manchester United player was a surprise signing for the six-time Korean champions in February, easily the biggest in the league's 41-year history. Listen to the latest Football Daily podcast Expectations followed suit. Almost 52,000 turned up - the highest attendance in Asia's oldest professional league since it started counting only purchased tickets in 2018 - to see Lingard's home debut against Incheon United on 10 March. Every touch was cheered initially but there have, as yet, been no goals or assists. Even without injuries, there was a recognition there would be some rustiness, with Lingard's last appearance before arriving in South Korea coming back in April 2023 for Nottingham Forest. Flashes of form "While we all hoped that he would immediately make a big difference for Seoul, we also knew that it would probably take time as he has not played for so long," Seoul fan Kim Yong-myung told the BBC. "Most fans still think that he will be a big help if he can stay fit." There have been flashes of the ability that took the midfielder into the England team - the last of his 32 caps coming in 2021. A smart through ball against Incheon almost resulted in a goal for the 31 year-old on his debut and there was a lob and turn that delighted fans. Against Jeju United the following week, despite a heavy first touch ending a potential one-on-one situation, some smart passing resulted in an own goal, only for that to be ruled out for an offside. Injuries mean he has not featured since for Seoul, who are in a similar mid-table position to that in which they finished last season. Lingard has missed Seoul's past four K-League games with a knee injury Rather than performances on the pitch, the biggest talking points so far surrounding Lingard have stemmed from comments by FC Seoul head coach Kim Ki-dong. "He only played a few minutes, and yet he didn't work hard and avoided tussle," Kim said, according to national newspaper Joongang Daily after the Jeju game, Lingard's third, in which he came off the bench after 58 minutes. "Fame doesn't win football games. If it did, I would have brought in a famous retired player." This reaction made headlines around the world. In Asia, Korean coaches are well known for demanding maximum physical effort from players at all times, but journalist Lee Sung-mo believes that a little has been lost in translation. "It happens quite often when you translate English to Korean or Korean to English without context," Lee said. "In Korean culture, Kim's comments were closer to motivation for Lingard as he wanted him to show more passion on the pitch because he had belief in the player. "But when you just translate it in English without context, it could be understood as aggressive criticism. It's very unlikely Kim intended that way." That is the way it seemed when Kim sought to cool the situation. "Some parts about that are a little exaggerated," said Kim, who took the Seoul job in December. "I told him that I said that in the interview because he is a special player who should take a leading role." Lingard also said that he had talked with the coach and there was no issue. Regardless of the intention, the international image was that Lingard's Korea move was turning into a nightmare. Lingard joined FC Seoul in February, 10 months after his last appearance for Nottingham Forest It would not be the first time a British player has struggled in the region. Paul Gascoigne had a short cameo in China, and while Jay Bothroyd impressed in Japan, Gary Lineker's time with Nagoya Grampus was marred by injury. In South Korea, former Burnley striker Andy Cooke had a prolific spell 20 years ago for Busan under Ian Porterfield but others, such as Chris Marsden, who signed from Southampton in 2004, and Jordon Mutch, who arrived after leaving Crystal Palace in 2019, did not reach double figures for appearances. Standards are high. The K-League is regarded as one of the top three leagues in Asia, along with those in Japan and Saudi Arabia, and it has the most successful record of any league in terms of winning continental championships. Off the pitch, it can be challenging too. "It seems to be tough for European players to adapt," said Lee. "The language is totally different, the weather is different and the culture is different. So it is not easy unless the player is ready to open up himself into a new situation and environment." Lingard seems willing to do that. "He may not be playing, but he is coming to watch our games," said Kim. "He is also active on social media and posting positively. It seems like he has the right attitude and wants to succeed. We have to wait for him to get fit, settle, and then he will be able to show us what he can do." There is still time, according to journalist Lee. "Lingard has been a bit unlucky so far and he's clearly showing his commitment for his new club even when he cannot play for them. We need to wait to see until he fully recovers from injuries. "There's still a chance that he could be a success in the K-League."

Image credit: Ubisoft News by Liv Ngan Contributor Published on 22 Mar 2024 15 comments Follow Star Wars Outlaws Ubisoft's open-world RPG Star Wars Outlaws has been rated in South Korea as adults only due to its inclusion of in-game gambling elements. The game's 19+ rating was published yesterday on the website for the Game Rating and Administration Committee , the South Korean games rating board, as spotted by reddit user Ajxtt. According to the GRAC's rating guide , a 19+ rating is used when its deemed that a game contains "representations of anti-societal idea, religion and public morals that would be harmful to children under 19 emotionally and physically". To see this content please enable targeting cookies. Manage cookie settings Star Wars Outlaws: Official World Premiere Trailer Watch on YouTube Specifically, Star Wars Outlaws has been flagged for gambling. According to the GRAC, a game will be rated 19+ for "reproduction of gambling spirit (existence of arousing of passion of excessive use of gaming money, or dependence on one's luck, but no real gaining or loss of one's asset)". Even without a translation of the full rating , the content descriptor for gambling is the only one which has been confirmed (유 - present, as opposed to 무 - not present). The South Korean ratings board's decision for Star Wars Outlaws. | Image credit: Eurogamer / GRAC In English, the basis for the 19+ rating reads as follows (translated by Eurogamer): "Realistic depictions of speculative behaviour. Presence of a mini-game which contains in-game betting and payouts." The rating doesn't mention any real-world gambling mechanics such as loot boxes. Eurogamer has contacted Ubisoft for confirmation and we'll update if we hear back. In South Korea, gambling is strictly controlled and considered unlawful, which could factor into the board's decision to give Star Wars Outlaws a 19+ rating rather than a more lenient 15+ (which is given if a game contains a "low level of reproduction of gambling spirit". At the beginning of the year, Star Wars owner Disney said Outlaws would release in "late" 2024 for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X/S, though it later backtracked on the timeframe as just "in 2024". The game will revisit familiar locations like Tatooine and Mos Eisley , with no procedurally generated planets in sight.

German state gov. ditching Windows for Linux, 30K workers migrating | Ars Technica Skip to main content Biz & IT Tech Science Policy Cars Gaming & Culture Store Forums Subscribe Close Navigate Store Subscribe Videos Features Reviews RSS Feeds Mobile Site About Ars Staff Directory Contact Us Advertise with Ars Reprints Filter by topic Biz & IT Tech Science Policy Cars Gaming & Culture Store Forums Settings Front page layout Grid List Site theme light dark Sign in Open source FTW    — German state gov. ditching Windows for Linux, 30K workers migrating Schleswig-Holstein looks to succeed where Munich failed. Scharon Harding - Apr 5, 2024 7:03 pm UTC Enlarge Getty reader comments 305 Schleswig-Holstein, one of Germany’s 16 states, on Wednesday confirmed plans to move tens of thousands of systems from Microsoft Windows to Linux. The announcement follows previously established plans to migrate the state government off Microsoft Office in favor of open source LibreOffice. As spotted by The Document Foundation , the government has apparently finished its pilot run of LibreOffice and is now announcing plans to expand to more open source offerings. In 2021, the state government announced plans to move 25,000 computers to LibreOffice by 2026. At the time, Schleswig-Holstein said it had already been testing LibreOffice for two years. As announced on Minister-President Daniel Gunther’s webpage this week, the state government confirmed that it's moving all systems to the Linux operating system (OS), too. Per a website-provided translation: With the cabinet decision, the state government has made the concrete beginning of the switch away from proprietary software and towards free, open-source systems and digitally sovereign IT workplaces for the state administration's approximately 30,000 employees. The state government is offering a training program that it said it will update as necessary. Regarding LibreOffice, the government maintains the possibility that some jobs may use software so specialized that they won't be able to move to open source software. In 2021, Jan Philipp Albrecht, then-minister for Energy, Agriculture, the Environment, Nature, and Digitalization of Schleswig-Holstein, discussed interest in moving the state government off of Windows. "Due to the high hardware requirements of Windows 11, we would have a problem with older computers. With Linux we don't have that," Albrecht told Heise magazine, per a Google translation. This week's announcement also said that the Schleswig-Holstein government will ditch Microsoft Sharepoint and Exchange/Outlook in favor of open source offerings Nextcloud and Open-Xchange, and Mozilla Thunderbird in conjunction with the Univention active directory connector . Schleswig-Holstein is also developing an open source directory service to replace Microsoft's Active Directory and an open source telephony offering. Digital sovereignty dreams Explaining the decision, the Schleswig-Holstein government's announcement named enhanced IT security, cost efficiencies, and collaboration between different systems as its perceived benefits of switching to open source software. Advertisement Further, the government is pushing the idea of digital sovereignty, with Schleswig-Holstein Digitalization Minister Dirk Schrödter quoted in the announcement as comparing the concept's value to that of energy sovereignty. The announcement also quoted Schrödter as saying that digital sovereignty isn't achievable "with the current standard IT workplace products." Schrödter pointed to the state government's growing reliance on cloud services and said that with related proprietary software, users have no influence on data flow and whether that data makes its way to other countries. Schrödter also claimed that the move would help with the state's budget by diverting money from licensing fees to "real programming services from our domestic digital economy" that could also create local jobs. In 2021, Albrecht said the state was reaching its limits with proprietary software contracts because "license fees have continued to rise in recent years," per Google's translation. "Secondly, regarding our goals for the digitalization of administration, open source simply offers us more flexibility," he added. At the time, Albrecht claimed that 90 percent of video conferences in the state government ran on the open source program Jitsi, which was advantageous during the COVID-19 pandemic because the state was able to quickly increase video conferencing capacity. Additionally, he said that because the school portal was based on (unnamed) open source software, "we can design the interface flexibly and combine services the way we want." There are numerous other examples globally of government entities switching to Linux in favor of open source technology. Federal governments with particular interest in avoiding US-based technologies, including North Korea and China , are some examples. The South Korean government has also shared plans to move to Linux by 2026, and the city of Barcelona shared migration plans in 2018. But some government bodies that have made the move regretted it and ended up crawling back to Windows. Vienna released the Debian-based distribution WIENUX in 2005 but gave up on migration by 2009. In 2003, Munich announced it would be moving some 14,000 PCs off Windows and to Linux. In 2013, the LiMux project finished, but high associated costs and user dissatisfaction resulted in Munich announcing in 2017 that it would spend the next three years reverting back to Windows. Albrecht in 2021 addressed this failure when speaking to Heise, saying, per Google's translation: The main problem there was that the employees weren't sufficiently involved. We do that better. We are planning long transition phases with parallel use. And we are introducing open source step by step where the departments are ready for it. This also creates the reason for further rollout because people see that it works. reader comments 305 Scharon Harding Scharon is Ars Technica’s Senior Product Reviewer writing news, reviews, and analysis on consumer technology, including laptops, mechanical keyboards, and monitors.

Email Facebook X Whatsapp LinkedIn Telegram Telegram Uniting Gamers Everywhere: Xbox Game Pass's Cross-Platform Expansion Brings Diverse Gaming Devices Together. Here’s everything you need to know about Microsoft’s subscription, Xbox Game Pass, from prices to selection. If you’re an Xbox user, chances are you’ve seen talk about Xbox Game Pass. If you’re unsure what it entails, then look no further. With subscription services for virtually everything nowadays, Xbox Game Pass is Microsoft’s answer to a monthly gaming subscription. Here’s how it works. What is Xbox Game Pass? Xbox Game Pass is a subscription service for Xbox One, Series X, or Series 3 console users, where gamers pay a monthly fee to get unlimited access to a catalog of selected games. You can play them as often or for as long as you like, likened to being a streaming-service-style offering, rather than buying individual games. The Xbox Game Pass includes some tempting games, including major AAA titles like GTA V and Sunset Overdrive. It also leans into some hard-hitting nostalgia by regularly including old Xbox 360 titles, repurposed for modern consoles through backwards compatibility. As well as offering the chance to play the Xbox Game Pass catalogue, the pass also offers access to new games on the day they’re released, for no extra cost. How often is Xbox Game Pass updated? Microsoft adds new games to the Xbox Game Pass each month, usually updated via the Xbox blog the week before. Some games will stay on the pass for one month but most stay longer than that. At any given time, there are usually around 300 games available to play. How much is Xbox Game Pass? Xbox Game Pass has a few subscription levels to it, each one costing a different amount, ranging from $9.99 a month to $16.99. Microsoft also regularly offers deals for new subscribers , such as your first month for $1. Here’s a closer look at what each plan offers subscribers. Xbox Game Pass Core Xbox Game Pass Core, once known as Xbox Live Gold, is the cheaper of the two options at $9.99. It offers a range of online multiplayer games, access to a collection of more than 25 titles, and member-only purchase deals on new releases. Xbox Game Pass Core took over Xbox Live Gold memberships on September 14, 2023. Customers were automatically switched over from Gold to Core, with no need for them to do anything. Xbox Game Pass Ultimate For the slightly more expensive subscription option at $16.99 a month, Xbox Game Pass Ultimate includes all the same benefits as Xbox Game Pass Core, while also combining services for both PC and consoles, so you don’t need to have separate subscriptions to game on multiple devices. Xbox Game Pass Ultimate users also have access to the Xbox Game Pass mobile app, offering the ability to play on the go for Android users (although not yet for iPhone) and sync game data across multiple devices via the cloud. Some games will also offer exclusive Ultimate perks, like extra add-ons, DLCs, and member discounts for updates and new releases that aren’t available to Core subscribers. How does Xbox Game Pass work? Once you have your subscription, it’s pretty easy to get online and start playing. Much like downloading a free game or one from the cloud, accessing Xbox Game Pass titles can be done via the library. Visit the Game Pass tab or the Recently added channel to see what’s available and then download it to your account. Downloading the game means you won’t need to stream it (although that’s possible to do with many games), reducing lag and dips in video quality. For the next 30 days, Xbox Game Pass subscribers can play any downloaded games for free. After those 30 days, you’ll need to reconnect the game to the internet to verify for your subscription. So long as you’re still subscribed and the game is still included in the Game Pass, you won’t need to pay to continue playing the game and your history will be saved. Where is Xbox Game Pass available? The Xbox Game Pass is currently available in the following countries, with more planned to come: Argentina Australia Austria Belgium Brazil Canada Chile Colombia Czech Republic Denmark Finland France Germany Greece Hong Kong Hungary India Ireland Israel Italy Japan Mexico The Netherlands New Zealand Norway Poland Portugal Russia Saudi Arabia Singapore Slovakia South Africa South Korea Spain Sweden Switzerland Taiwan Turkey The United Arab Emirates The United Kingdom The United States On the whole, most Xbox Game Pass titles are the same around the world, with few differences between countries. Sometimes, the United States has had access to different games or with slightly different dates, but Microsoft tends to stick with the same offering around the world.

But South Korean officials are reportedly weighing the U.S. request because of possible repercussions on major South Korean firms, including Samsung and SK Hynix, operating in China — its largest trading partner .

The controls follow a 2019 ban by then-President Donald Trump on shipments from U.S. companies to Chinese consumer electronics maker Huawei without an export license. South Korean memory chips make up the largest market share in China, and the country is behind  only Japan for supplying silicon wafers to China, according to a February report from the Korea Institute for International Economic Policy cited by Bloomberg. In March, Bloomberg reported South Korea is looking into a multinational framework to review export controls products including chipmaking-related technology . Meanwhile, the U.S. is reportedly set to reveal the names of Chinese companies on its blacklist for receiving U.S.-made chipmaking equipment.

By Collin Woodard / Jalopnik Published March 31, 2024 We may earn a commission from links on this page . Photo : Pool / Pool ( Getty Images ) Korea’s auto industry is currently killing it, but its baby-birthing industry may as well be dead. The East Asian country has the lowest fertility rate in the world, which isn’t great long-term. Don’t worry, though, Reuters reports that Korean officials have the perfect solution for getting those childless young folks to start cranking out babies — a new train service .

Instead, the high-speed rail service is designed to address the biggest issues that Koreans say are stopping them from starting families such as long commutes and the housing situation in Seoul, which often requires paying a lot of money for an apartment that’s too small to raise a family in. Advertisement So far, government subsidies haven’t been very effective at getting Koreans to have more kids, so the idea is to build six new lines for underground speed trains that will make it faster and more convenient for people who work in Seoul to live in less expensive areas further out from the city. Then, once those workers realize they have all that extra space and more time for themselves, they’ll decide it’s time to start making babies. Advertisement Once the $99.5 billion project is completed, the estimates for how much it will reduce commute times are pretty significant. While the bus ride to Dongtan currently takes about 80 minutes, the train is expected to bring that commute down to less than 20 minutes. Incidentally, the U.S. also has a declining birth rate. Maybe Uncle Sam should take a page out of Korea’s book and start building trains, too. You know, for the babies. Give us more trains, and we’ll make so many babies.

A South Korean news channel reports the launch, using footage from a previous test [Ahn Young-joon/AP] Published On 2 Apr 2024 2 Apr 2024 North Korea has fired a suspected intermediate-range ballistic missile into the sea off its east coast. South Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff said that it detected the launch from the area of the North Korean capital Pyongyang on Tuesday at 6.53am (21:53 GMT on Monday).

Tokyo confirmed the launch, with the coastguard urging vessels to be vigilant and report any fallen objects without approaching them. Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida condemned the launch, telling reporters North Korea had “repeatedly launched ballistic missiles” this year, adding that it was a threat to regional security and “absolutely unacceptable”. The launch was the third of a ballistic missile in 2024, with North Korea saying it is testing a new intermediate-range hypersonic missile powered by a solid-fuel engine. It comes just days after a Russian veto ended United Nations expert monitoring of North Korean sanctions violations, amid a probe into alleged arms deals between Moscow and Pyongyang, and a week before South Korea holds general elections. “The Kim regime prioritizes advancing its military capabilities and doesn’t care to stay quiet during the South Korean legislative election campaign,” Leif-Eric Easley, a professor at Ewha University in Seoul, wrote in emailed comments. “But firing an intermediate-range missile lacks the shock value of a full-range ICBM [intercontinental ballistic missile] launch or a nuclear test, so it’s unlikely to swing any National Assembly seats. Although Pyongyang’s weapons development remains a major concern, Seoul is currently focused on health care reform, economic policies, and domestic political scandals.” Pyongyang has continued to develop its military arsenal despite strict international sanctions imposed over its nuclear weapons programme. It has also declared South Korea its “principal enemy”, shut down agencies dedicated to reunification and outreach, and threatened war over “even 0.001 mm” of territorial infringement. Last month, the United States and South Korea staged one of their major annual joint military exercises, prompting angry retorts and live-fire drills from Pyongyang, which condemns all such exercises as rehearsals for invasion. Seoul is one of Washington’s key regional allies and the US has about 27,000 soldiers stationed in South Korea.

After success of BTS and Parasite, South Korea woos digital nomads | Technology | Al Jazeera Skip links Skip to Content play Live Show navigation menu Navigation menu News Show more news sections Middle East Africa Asia US & Canada Latin America Europe Asia Pacific Israel War on Gaza Features Opinion Video More Show more sections Economy Ukraine war Coronavirus Climate Crisis Investigations Interactives In Pictures Science & Technology Sport Podcasts play Live Click here to search search Economy | Technology After success of BTS and Parasite, South Korea woos digital nomads Critics say the criteria for new digital nomad visa are too stringent to attract remote workers in large numbers. South Korea has emerged as one of Asia's most popular destinations in recent years [Ed Jones/AFP] By Raphael Rashid Published On 19 Mar 2024 19 Mar 2024 Seoul, South Korea – Riding the wave of enthusiasm for all things Korean, South Korea has in recent years become one of Asia’s most popular tourist destinations. Now, the cultural juggernaut known for the K-pop band BTS , the movie Parasite and Korean BBQ and kimchi is setting its sights on cornering the market for a new kind of traveller: the digital nomad. Keep reading list of 4 items list 1 of 4 Russia’s Putin hails victory in election criticised as illegitimate list 2 of 4 Russia-Ukraine war: List of key events, day 753 list 3 of 4 Uber pays $178m to settle lawsuit with taxi drivers in Australia list 4 of 4 North Korea fires ballistic missiles as Blinken visits Seoul end of list In January, the South Korean government launched its “workation” visa, joining the global trend of countries seeking an economic boost by tapping into the growing pool of transient remote workers. Marco, a software engineer from Switzerland who has been working remotely in South Korea for more than a year, is among those planning to apply for the visa after falling in love with the country’s culture and food. “For a lot of things, I have to rely on friends to help me out, which constantly makes you feel left out,” Marco, who asked to use only his first name, told Al Jazeera. Without longer-term residency, Marco must make regular visa runs and cannot access many services that require documentation. Buying tickets online, ordering food deliveries and registering a phone number all require a foreign resident card, which tourist visa-holders are not eligible to receive. For prospective applicants like Marco, however, there’s a catch: a substantial income requirement that has locked out many digital nomads from consideration. Applicants for the F-1-D Workation Visa are required to prove an annual income of at least 84.96 million won ($64,000) – about twice the South Korean average. Applicants must also have an employment contract and medical insurance coverage of at least $100,000, among other conditions. South Korean culture has grown in popularity worldwide [Chung Sung-Jun/Getty Images] “It seems to me to be a ‘Cali tech bro’ visa, not a nomad visa,” David, a freelance copywriter from the UK, told Al Jazeera, using common shorthand for the US state of California. David, who is based in South Korea’s second-largest city of Busan, said he does not meet the salary requirement despite doing work for a string of global companies. “Twice the national salary seems a little steep and it seems the government wants to keep out people from so-called ‘unwanted’ countries from applying,” said David, who asked to be referred to by his first name. Seoul has promoted the visa as a means to attract “high-income foreigners” and “stimulate economic activity”. Under the visa’s terms, holders can stay in the country for 12 months, with the option to extend their stay by a further year, but cannot be employed locally. When first announcing the visa in 2021, officials said the employment condition was intended to ensure the visa would not be abused by backpackers without sufficient funds to support their stay. South Korea’s income requirement is one of the highest among countries offering digital nomad visas. The Czech Republic requires earnings of about $2,700 per month, about 1.5 times the average annual salary, while Dubai asks for a monthly income of about $3,500. In Asia, Malaysia’s recently introduced digital nomad visa requires an income equivalent to about $2,000 per month. Japan’s new digital nomad visa requires earnings of about $5,530 per month. Andrea, a digital marketing coordinator in the US whose main client recently established a headquarters in Seoul, said she was disappointed about South Korea’s conditions. “I live in California and my wage right now is definitely not even close to what is required,” Andrea, who asked to be referred to by her first name, told Al Jazeera. “Even my current partner who works for an established financial banking company barely makes the cut.” South Korea is seeking to attract digital nomads [Ed Jones/AFP] Despite complaints from some potential applicants that the scheme is inaccessible, Jeong Hyun Cho, founder of the Digital Nomads Korea community, remains optimistic about the programme’s potential. “Korea has an undeniable strength in advanced technology and fast internet connections, even in rural areas,” Cho told Al Jazeera. “This is both an attraction point and a necessity for digital nomads, who mostly work in the IT and tech industry.” Cho, who runs the co-living and working space Hoppin House in Seoul, said the scheme could be expanded in the future. “Understanding this visa as a pilot phase, I see the government’s rationale in setting a high-income bar initially, which could be adjusted based on the programme’s outcomes,” she said. “We’re hopeful for future revisions to make the visa more accessible.” Indeed, data from Cho’s Digital Nomads Korea community, which boasts more than 1,300 members, shows a strong interest in the programme, with 84 percent of respondents to a survey expressing a desire to apply. Still, Cho acknowledges that many in her community have faced challenges navigating the application process and policies that are sometimes unclear. “They are simply struggling gathering clear information and facing many obstacles with the administrative processes,” she said. As of February 29, South Korea had received just 31 formal applications for the digital nomad visa. K-pop acts like BTS have boosted South Korea’s international profile [Chris Pizzello/AP]) South Korea’s Ministry of Justice said the income threshold was set after a comprehensive consideration of factors, including overseas benchmarks, domestic living costs, potential tourism spending and the risk of illegal overstays or employment. The ministry reiterated that freelancers are not considered eligible and did not elaborate on whether the salary threshold would be lowered. “During the pilot operation period, various opinions related to the digital nomad visa will be gathered to review the direction for improving the system,” the ministry told Al Jazeera in a statement. Despite not yet qualifying, Andrea, the digital marketing coordinator, remains positive. “I remain hopeful the government will eventually be more lenient on the wage factor or at least allow people to show proof of a stable job,” she said. “Due to the new and future influx of foreign investments, workers and tourists, it will have to eventually change to cater to the newer generation and times.” Source : Al Jazeera aj-logo aj-logo aj-logo About Show more About Us Code of Ethics Terms and Conditions EU/EEA Regulatory Notice Privacy Policy Cookie Policy Cookie Preferences Sitemap Work for us HR Quality Connect Show more Contact Us User Accounts Help Advertise with us Apps Newsletters Channel Finder TV Schedule Podcasts Submit a Tip Our Channels Show more Al Jazeera Arabic Al Jazeera English Al Jazeera Investigative Unit Al Jazeera Mubasher Al Jazeera Documentary Al Jazeera Balkans AJ+ Our Network Show more Al Jazeera Centre for Studies Al Jazeera Media Institute Learn Arabic Al Jazeera Centre for Public Liberties & Human Rights Al Jazeera Forum Al Jazeera Hotel Partners Follow Al Jazeera English: facebook twitter youtube instagram-colored-outline rss © 2024 Al Jazeera Media Network

I know that's better than it used to be, but it's still not good enough Bill Grueskin / @bgrueskin : Trump's Truth Social company posted its new financials to the SEC today. The firm generated just $4.1 million (with an M) revenue for all of 2023, while racking up $58 million in net losses. Market cap is > $6 billion. (This isn't an April 1 joke.) https://app.quotemedia.com/...

Consider me skeptical. Dan Primack / @danprimack : NEW: Trump's Truth Social lost $58 million last year. Moreover, revenue DECLINED between Q3 and Q4 2023, with the company bringing in just $751,000 between Oct-Dec of last year. https://www.axios.com/... @morningbrew : Truth Social vs. Reddit Truth Social - Revenue: $4.6 million - Market Cap: $9.7 billion - Monthly active users: 5 million Reddit - Revenue: $804 million - Market Cap: $11 billion - Daily active users: 73 million Make it make sense. @bradmunchen : It's hilarious how Truth Social $DJT—which has close to zero revenues—is now worth $8.4bn, or 7% more than Twitter's valuation of $7.8bn. I wonder which pisses Musk off more: Twitter having a lower valuation than $DJT or Toyota $TM having outperformed $TSLA by 67% YTD. [image] Josh Marshall / @joshtpm : Simple points. Truth Social has roughly the same annual revenues as @TPM. (I am, very unfairly, not a billionaire.) it has roughly 20x the expenses. And it has close to no user base. Judd Legum / @juddlegum : Truth Social has a multi-billion dollar valuation thanks to Trump supporters that are driving up the share price. But it's an awful business. Less than $4 million in revenue in 2023. $58 million in loses. Basically a money incinerator. [image] @jeffjarvis : A new spectator sport: Watch DJT fall. https://www.google.com/...

Xeta One is a QWERTY phone cobbled from an LG Wing, but don't buy it Search results for All search results Best daily deals Affiliate links on Android Authority may earn us a commission. Learn more. Mobile Innovative LG Wing is being cobbled into a new, even more bizarre phone It's available to back in a crowdfunding campaign, but please don't. By C. Scott Brown • Published on March 26, 2024 TL;DR A phone called Xeta One is in the crowdfunding stage. It’s a QWERTY phone that cannibalized the LG Wing, one of LG’s last smartphones. You should definitely not back this phone’s crowdfunding campaign, but it’s interesting to look at. One of the final phones from LG before its unfortunate exit from the smartphone industry was the LG Wing. This innovative Android phone featured a swivel mechanism similar to what we saw on the T-Mobile Sidekick back in the late aughts. When swiveled, the main display would go landscape and reveal another smaller display underneath. Ostensibly, LG produced a lot of those phones before it threw in the towel. What happened to them? Well, now we know at least some of them have been cannibalized to make a truly bizarre QWERTY phone called Xeta One . Created in South Korea (LG’s home turf), this phone takes the smaller inner display of the Wing, slaps a BlackBerry keyboard on it (complete with optical trackpad, possibly from the BlackBerry Q20), and powers the whole thing with Android. You can see a one-sheet of specs below or in the video above: Xeta The crowdfunding campaign for the Xeta One is region-locked to South Korea, so most people reading this won’t be able to back it. However, you really shouldn’t back this, regardless, as it seems pretty scammy. The fine print in both the video and the website even says this is “a renovation project” and “not a device sold for mass production purposes.” In other words, this could be a situation in which one tinkerer in South Korea is making these as a hobby and looking for someone to foot the bill. Either way, though, it is interesting to see LG’s final attempt at shaking up the smartphone world live on. The Wing was a really cool phone, and it’s a shame we never got a sequel. Be sure to check out our original review of the LG Wing if you missed it. Got a tip? Talk to us! Email our staff at news@androidauthority.com .

A Buzzy Korean Horror Movie Is Sneakily One Of The Biggest Box Office Hits Of 2024 × NEWS MOVIES TV TRAILERS REVIEWS EXCLUSIVES FEATURES Podcast Newsletter Advertise About Editorial Policies Reviews Policy Privacy Policy Terms of Use © 2024 Static Media . All Rights Reserved A Buzzy Korean Horror Movie Is Sneakily One Of The Biggest Box Office Hits Of 2024 NEWS MOVIES TV TRAILERS REVIEWS EXCLUSIVES FEATURES Newsletter Advertise Movies Horror Movies A Buzzy Korean Horror Movie Is Sneakily One Of The Biggest Box Office Hits Of 2024 Well Go USA By Ryan Scott / March 28, 2024  10:00 am EST 2024 is (or at least was) off to a somewhat slow start at the box office. Ticket sales are pacing around 9% behind compared to this same point in 2023, but there are reasons to be optimistic. Not only do we have movies like "Dune: Part Two" and the upcoming "Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire" to help bring movie theaters some much-needed business, but a buzzy, original, Korean horror-thriller has sneakily become one of the biggest hits of the year thus far. The movie in question is "Exhuma." Directed by Jang Jae-Hyun, it has been on an absolute tear in South Korea, topping the charts five weekends in a row. Movies like "Dune: Part Two" have been unable to take the top spot away from it. "Exhuma" has, as of this writing, made more than $73 million in the country and is one of the biggest hits there in the pandemic era. It has sold more than 10 million tickets, which is the level at which a movie is certified as a blockbuster in the country. Considering it has a population of around 50 million, that's truly impressive. So, what is this blockbuster you might not have even heard of? The official synopsis reads as follows: When a renowned shaman (Kim Go-Eun) and her protégé (Lee Do-hyun) are hired by a wealthy, enigmatic family, they begin investigating the cause of a disturbing supernatural illness that affects only the first-born children of each generation. With the help of a knowledgeable mortician (Yoo Hai-jin) and the country's most revered geomancer (Choi Min-sik), they soon trace the affliction's origin to a long-hidden family grave located on sacred ground. Sensing an ominous aura surrounding the burial site, the team opts to exhume and relocate the ancestral remains immediately. But as something much darker emerges, they soon discover what befalls those who dare to mess with the wrong grave. Exhuma is a massive hit in South Korea Well Go USA Looking at the slightly larger picture, "Exhuma" is now the 12th biggest movie worldwide released so far in 2024, with a global total of $75 million. It sits just below director Matthew Vaughn's very expensive spy movie "Argylle" ($95.8 million), released by Apple. As the film continues its run in South Korea and expands throughout the rest of the world, it has a real shot at crossing the $100 million mark, which would put it above Sony's Marvel Comics adaptation "Madame Web" ($97.6 million) as well. "Exhuma" is currently playing in the U.S. and several other countries, including New Zealand and the U.K. For what it's worth, the thriller did quite well for itself (relatively speaking) this past weekend in North America, taking in $489,761 on just 67 screens, giving it a stellar $7,310 per screen average, indicating that the buzz for this one is building even outside of its native country. As we've seen in the past with movies like Best Picture winner "Parasite," American audiences will show up for the right Korean import. "Parasite" ended up pulling in a very impressive $53.3 million in the States back in 2019, en route to $258 million worldwide. Whether or not "Exhuma" manages to break through the same way remains to be seen. Even if it doesn't, we're talking about an original movie that is making very good money and generating a lot of buzz. So far as the health of the global theatrical marketplace is concerned, that's excellent news. In a down year, success stories such as this are more than welcome. "Exhuma" is in theaters now.

What are the issues and how has the government responded? Written by Neha Banka Kolkata | Updated: March 29, 2024  11:45 IST Follow Us Doctors chant slogans during a rally to protest against government plans to increase medical school admissions in Seoul, South Korea, March 3, 2024. (REUTERS: Photo) For around six weeks now, thousands of junior doctors have walked off their jobs in South Korea and refused to see patients. They have been protesting against a government plan that intends to sharply increase medical school admissions and the number of physicians in the country. More and more doctors are joining the agitation. In the latest escalation, senior doctors at major hospitals have come out in support, going as far as submitting their resignation letters in protest. What are the issues here? We explain. Why are South Korean doctors protesting? The junior doctors said their protests are rooted in the present working conditions and the existing pay. They demand that the government should first address these issues before attempting to increase the number of working physicians in South Korea. Advertisement The South Korean government, however, argued that the country needs more working doctors to address the needs of residents in rural parts of the country and meet healthcare demands. With junior doctors sitting in protest, the functioning of hospitals has also been impacted across the country. A shortage of working doctors has meant that surgical procedures are being cancelled and even emergency rooms have had to turn back patients. However, doctors have said these issues highlight the workload they have to deal with and that the current system is broken. According to a Korea Times report, the five biggest hospitals in Seoul — Seoul National University Hospital, Seoul Asan Medical Center, Samsung Medical Center, Severance Hospital and Seoul St. Mary’s Hospital — play a key role in providing medical care for patients in critical conditions. Junior doctors account for 39 per cent of their staff. Advertisement Best of Explained Nestlé's baby food sold in Asian, African countries had added sugars: Why is sugar harmful? Cost and benefit: Israel’s very expensive defence against aerial threats Anti-Maoist operations status report: What is the significance of Apr 16 encounter? Click here for more Keeping the number of junior doctors high is intentional, mainly because of their lower labour costs, The Korea Times reported. According to a Reuters report, junior doctors or trainees typically work 80 to 100 hours, five days a week – meaning up to 20 hours a day. Protesting doctors said these working conditions need to be addressed by hiring more senior staff and not increasing the number of trainees or junior doctors. What has the government said? The South Korean government has said the increase in the number of doctors is intended to fill an expected shortfall of some 15,000 doctors by 2035. These are significant numbers for a country like South Korea, with a smaller population than India. Following the protests, the government issued a back-to-work order to doctors who walked off the job and vowed to prosecute those who did not comply. This week, however, the government shifted from its stance and said that it would be “open to dialogue and welcome suggestions to improve its plan,” a report in The Korea Times said. Additionally, the government has also asked the country’s military hospitals and police hospitals to accept civilian patients to prevent further continued disruption of medical services. Advertisement Read | Why doctors are protesting rule to prescribe generic drugs But in February, when the protests first started, South Korea’s President Yoon Suk-yeol had said the protesting doctors were holding patients “hostage” by their actions. A Korea Times report quoted him as saying: “The government is pushing to reform the country’s health care system”. He added, “The decision is not negotiable, as adding 2,000 slots (to the number of medical school seats) is deemed a minimal increase to implement the constitutional responsibility of the state to provide timely and proper medical treatment to sick people.” Despite a softening of the government’s stance, senior doctors at major hospitals in South Korea began submitting their resignations this week in support of medical interns and residents, although they have promised to continue working despite the resignations. The Korea Times reported that senior doctors have “demanded the government first scrap the decision to increase the medical school quota by 2,000 from the current 3,058, saying it would sit down for talks with the government only if the plan is abolished.” What the medical community has said Advertisement Healthcare in South Korea is among the best in the world, analysts said. Many in the country’s medical community said that the number of doctors is not a problem. According to a Reuters report, South Korea’s medical community believes that the number cited by the government that it wants to use to boost medical admissions is arbitrary and the authorities have not made the basis for that figure open to the public. The Reuters report quoted the medical community in South Korea as saying that without addressing underlying problems of pay and overwork among junior doctors, there is no incentive for the increased number of doctors to practise the essential discipline. © The Indian Express Pvt Ltd First uploaded on: 28-03-2024 at 19:48 IST Tags: Explained Global Express Explained South Korea Here’s Your Exclusive Pass To Premium Stories CLAIM NOW Latest Comment Post Comment Read Comments Advertisement JAC Jharkhand Board 10th Result 2024: Websites to check JAC Matric scorecard Education Updated: April 19, 2024  12:14 IST Jharkhand Academic Council (JAC) will declare the Class 10 results today (April 19) on their official websites.

The midfielder was detained in China last May “on suspicion of accepting bribes by non-state employees”, the Chinese government said at the time, without providing further details.

The government has provided “active legal assistance through close communication with Son’s family”, it added. The Foreign Ministry did not reveal when he returned or whether the charges against him were proven. “We have been communicating with Chinese authorities through various channels to request their cooperation in ensuring a fast and fair process [for Son] while also communicating closely with his family in South Korea,” the South Korean ministry said in a statement. It said it had conducted about 20 consular interviews with Son to provide assistance and ensure fair access to lawyers. The Korea Football Association confirmed Son’s release, saying the 31-year-old footballer had returned on Monday. Son played for Shandong Taishan football club in the Chinese Super League since 2021 and appeared in three of South Korea’s four matches during the 2022 Qatar World Cup. Son played seven seasons with South Korea’s Pohang Steelers and Jeonbuk Hyundai Motors before joining Shandong Taishan in 2021 on a four-year contract. He has played for South Korea 18 times.

At least $4.5 million in wire transfers from Ohtani’s bank account was sent through wire transfers to a bookmaker, ESPN reports . “Ippei has been stealing money from my account and told lies,” the 29-year-old designated hitter said via his interpreter Will Ireton during a press conference Monday afternoon. Ohtani did not answer questions from the press. Mizuhara has been tied to illegal bookmaker Mathew Bowyer, whose home was raided by federal agents last year, according to the Los Angeles Times . Sports betting is illegal in California, though 38 other U.S. states and the District of Columbia allow it in some form. A spokesperson for Ohtani originally told ESPN that the funds sent from the baseball player’s account were meant to cover Mizuhara’s gambling debt. “Obviously, he [Ohtani] wasn't happy about it and said he would help me out to make sure I never do this again,” Mizuhara told ESPN  on March 19. “I want everyone to know Shohei had zero involvement in betting. I want people to know I did not know this was illegal.” But the following day, lawyers representing Ohtani said that the baseball player had been the “victim of massive theft,” and denied that Ohtani had sent the funds. On Wednesday, Mizuhara also told ESPN that Ohtani was not aware of his gambling debt and did not send any money over. During Monday’s press conference, Ohtani said that after the press reached out to his representatives about his possible involvement in the sports betting scandal, Mizuhara had lied. “Ippei told to the media and my representatives that I, on behalf of a friend, paid off debts,” Ohtani said. Ohtani said he first learned of Mizuhara’s gambling issue during a team meeting after his first game in South Korea. Because Mizuhara spoke in English, and Ohtani did not have a translator, he did not fully understand what was being said but “started to feel that there was something amiss.” Later, during a one-on-one conversation between the baseball player and his interpreter, Ohtani says he realized that Mizuhara had incurred a massive debt. Ohtani says that he then contacted his representatives, the Dodgers, and his attorneys. He reiterated that he never agreed to make any payments to the bookmaker. Bowyer’s attorney told the L.A. Times that Bowyer had never been in contact with Ohtani, adding that Bowyer has not been charged with a crime. Bowyer’s attorney did not immediately return TIME’s request for comment. Major League Baseball policies say that employees are prohibited from placing any bets on a baseball game, or any other sports via an illegal bookmaking business. Mizuhara says he bet on international soccer, the NBA, NFL, and college football, but never baseball. “The season is going to start, so I'm going to obviously let my lawyers handle matters from here on out, and I am completely assisting in all investigations that are taking place right now,” Ohtani said.

In the world of South Korean pop music, it’s even more intense and fruaght than it usually is in the rest of the world. Case in point: NewJeans, the hugely popular K-pop girl group, are getting American courts involved in their attempts to shut down an anonymous YouTuber. The New York Times reports that representatives for NewJeans have requested that a California federal court order Google to reveal the identity of an anonymous YouTube user. In their court filing last month, NewJeans claimed that a YouTuber with the handle @Middle7 has made defamatory statements about the group in videos that have been viewed millions of times. NewJeans’ lawyer Eugene Kim also claims that the account has engaged in “name-calling or other mocking behavior,” which “continue to inflict significant reputational damage.” The account appears to be deleted now. Defamation and insult are criminal offenses in South Korea, and it’s apparently common practice for K-pop stars and their handlers to use prosecution and defamation lawsuits to defend their reputations. That’s relatively easy to do when the fans insulting the groups use social media platforms based in South Korea, but it’s harder on sites like YouTube, though Google has previously revealed the identity of a user who was defaming a member of the group IVE. NewJeans already filed a criminal complaint against @Middle7 at a Seoul police station, but since police didn’t know the identity of the YouTuber, they couldn’t go forward. It’s not entirely clear whether the YouTuber in question even comes from South Korea, and I’d be curious to know whether that would even have any bearing on this case.

(SMIC), one of China's largest chipmakers, operates ... [+] 200mm and 300mm facilities. Photographer: Qilai Shen/Bloomberg © 2024 Bloomberg Finance LP Mainland China will lead the world in equipment spending for industry mainstream 300mm semiconductor factories, with $30 billion in investments in each of the next four years, according to a forecast on Monday by U.S.-based industry group SEMI. Spending by the country will be “fueled by government incentives and domestic self-sufficiency policies,” SEMI said. 300mm refers to the diameter of wafers used in making semiconductors; it’s equivalent to about 12 inches. Taiwan is expected to rank second in equipment spending at $28 billion in 2027, an increase from $20.3 billion in 2024. South Korea is expected to rank third at $26.3 billion in 2027, up from $19.5 billion this year, SEMI said. The increases are part of an expected rise to a record $137 billion in spending in 2027 after surpassing $100 billion for the first time by 2025 on new AI-related applications, the strength of the memory chip recovery, and strong demand for high-performance computing and automotive applications, SEMI said. Growing demand for AI-related chips have sent shares of suppliers and manufacturers such as Nvidia and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. soaring in the past year. MORE FROM FORBES ADVISOR Best High-Yield Savings Accounts Of 2024 By Kevin Payne Contributor Best 5% Interest Savings Accounts of 2024 By Cassidy Horton Contributor “Projections for the steepening ramp of 300mm fab equipment spending in the coming years reflects the production capacity needed to meet growing demand for electronics across a diverse range of markets as well as a new wave of applications spawned by artificial intelligence innovation,” said Ajit Manocha, SEMI President and CEO, said in a statement. The report also highlighted the influence of government support in semiconductor manufacturing to bolster economies and security worldwide, Manocha said. “This trend is expected to help significantly narrow the equipment spending gap between re-emerging and emerging regions and the historical top-spending regions in Asia,” he said. China, one of the world’s largest manufacturers of electronics products, is pushing to reduce reliance on foreign suppliers of chips amid strained geopolitical strains and heighted focus on security by President Xi Jinping. The Financial Times reported today that China government has introduced guidelines that phase out purchases of chips from U.S. suppliers Intel and AMD for government-used PCs and servers. Microsoft Windows and foreign database would also be sidelined, it said. The Americas is projected to double 300mm fab equipment investments from $12 billion in 2024 to $24.7 billion in 2027. Just this past week, the U.S. Commerce Department announced a preliminary agreement to provide $8.5 billion to support four new Intel Corporation semiconductor manufacturing sites in Arizona, New Mexico, Ohio and Oregon. Elsewhere in the world, equipment spending in Japan, Europe & the Middle East, and Southeast Asia are expected to reach $11.4 billion, $11.2 billion, and $5.3 billion in 2027, SEMI said. Demand for greater data throughput, crucial for AI servers, is driving strong demand for high-bandwidth memory, or HBM, and spurring increased investment in memory technology, SEMI noted. Among all segments, memory ranked second and was predicted to generate $79.1 billion in equipment purchases in 2027, reflecting a 20% annual rise from 2023, the industry group said.

By: Reuters Seoul | April 2, 2024 15:07 IST Follow Us North Korea on Tuesday test-fired a suspected intermediate-range ballistic missile toward waters off its eastern coast, South Korea's military said, as it pushes to advance its weapons aimed at remote U.S. targets in the Pacific. (AP Photo) North Korea fired a suspected intermediate-range ballistic missile into the sea on Tuesday in a possible test of a new rocket using solid fuel, drawing swift condemnation from South Korea, Japan and the United States. South Korea’s military said it detected what appeared to be an intermediate-range ballistic missile launched from an area of the North Korean capital Pyongyang on Tuesday at 6:53 a.m. (2153 GMT on Monday) before plunging into the sea off the east coast. It flew about 600 km (372 miles) before falling into sea, South Korea said, while Japan’s defence ministry estimated it covered a distance of 650 km (400 miles) and reached a maximum altitude of 100 km (62 miles). Advertisement South Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff did not specify the exact type of missile or what type of warhead it may have carried, but North Korea has been testing a new intermediate-range hypersonic missile powered by a solid-fuel engine. Also Read | Why Russia is protecting North Korea from nuclear monitors South Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff spokesman Lee Sung-jun said the launch was probably “related” to the testing of a recent solid-fuel engine. In March, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un oversaw a ground test of a solid-fuel engine for a new type of intermediate-range hypersonic missile to develop national defence capability, state media reported. Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida condemned the launch as damaging for regional and international peace and stability. The U.S. Indo-Pacific Command said the event did not pose an immediate danger to its troops or allies but condemned it as an unlawful and destabilizing act. Advertisement South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol said the North could try to sow confusion in his country ahead of a parliamentary election this month. He said such an attempt would be futile and that the response to any North Korean aggression would be firm. U.S. B-52 BOMBER JOINS DRILLS Amid concerns Russia and North Korea are developing closer military links, the United States and its major Asian allies South Korea and Japan are expanding security cooperation. On Tuesday, aircraft from the three countries conducted air drills that involved a U.S. B-52H strategic bomber to enhance deterrence and counter capabilities against missile and nuclear threats from the North, South Korea said. Officials in the United States, South Korea and Ukraine have accused North Korea of providing weapons such as missiles to Russia for use in the Ukraine war. Pyongyang and Moscow have denied the allegations. Advertisement South Korea announced sanctions on two Russian vessels that it said had transported munitions between North Korea and Russia, and two Russian organisations involved in hiring North Korean workers to help Pyongyang earn foreign currency, South Korea’s foreign ministry said on Tuesday. Meanwhile, the United States government is arranging a summit between President Joe Biden and his Japanese and South Korean counterparts in July on the sidelines of a NATO summit in Washington, Japanese media outlets reported.

South Korean President Yoon Suk-yeol has urged striking doctors to return to work [Jung Yeon-je/AFP] Published On 1 Apr 2024 1 Apr 2024 South Korean President Yoon Suk-yeol has pledged not to back down on plans to increase medical school admissions as he accused striking doctors of operating as a “cartel”. In an address to the nation on Monday, Yoon said the planned addition of 2,000 medical school places was the minimum needed. Keep reading list of 3 items list 1 of 3 Tens of thousands take part in antigovernment protests in Israel list 2 of 3 The high cost of being a whistleblower in China list 3 of 3 OpenAI debuts voice cloning tool, but deems it too risky for public release end of list “The number 2,000 is not a random figure we came up with. We have thoroughly reviewed relevant statistics and research and reviewed present and future medical situations,” Yoon said, adding that the government’s reforms aimed to create “a medical environment where all people can receive treatment with a peace of mind”. Yoon said doctors opposed to the plans should stop “making threats” and present a “unified blueprint with clear scientific reasoning”. “If a more valid and reasonable plan is brought forward, we can discuss as much as they want,” he said. Some 12,000 junior doctors in South Korea have been on strike since early February over the proposals, forcing hospitals to cancel treatments and surgeries. South Korea’s government has argued that the reforms are necessary to alleviate staff shortages and manage the country’s rapid transition to an aged society. South Korea had 2.6 doctors per 1,000 people in 2022, according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), well below the average among developed nations. Trainee doctors argue that the medical system is not equipped to handle such a steep increase in new recruits and that medical services will suffer as a result. Doctors participating in the walkout face the risk of losing their medical licences after the government last month began taking steps to suspend them. Yoon urged the doctors to return to work before the process to suspend their licences was complete, saying collective action should only be considered “when I do not keep my promises”. Yoon also expressed regret at the inconvenience caused to the public, saying he was sorry he had been unable to “quickly resolve the inconveniences of the people”. Public approval of Yoon has declined as the strike has dragged on, with just over 36 percent of South Koreans expressing a positive view of the president in a RealMeter poll released on Monday. South Korea will hold parliamentary elections next week that will be crucial to Yoon’s chances of avoiding lame-duck status in the remaining three years of his five-year term.

This game rating, coupled with the earlier game rating in South Korea, suggests that Hollow Knight: Silksong's development is nearing completion and a release date will be announced soon. Hollow Knight: Silksong is a sequel to the critically acclaimed Hollow Knight. This title has been in development since 2019 and is set to launch on Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, Xbox Game Pass, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Nintendo Switch, and PC via Steam.

According to Comicbook.com , this leak is that Hollow Knight: Silksong has received its game rating in Australia from the country's classification website . It says that Hollow Knight: Silksong was rated at the beginning of April this year, and its age rating was designated as "PG" for containing mild violence. Besides that, the classification website doesn't provide concrete information on an official release date for the game. Comicbook.com has a theory about this sudden info leak. If you take this information and combine it with a leak Comicbook.com reported earlier this month when the game was officially rated in South Korea, along with being briefly listed on Xbox digital storefronts, this hints that the game has nearly finished development and a release date will be announced soon. However, it's best to take this info with a grain of salt as the game's developer and publisher Team Cherry has not made any official comments regarding these leaks nor have they announced an official release since they delayed Hollow Knight: Silksong last year . How much longer we will have to wait for Hollow Knight: Silksong? Top recommendations • Best Xbox headsets • Best Windows laptops • Best Xbox storage • Best gaming laptops For those unaware, Hollow Knight: Silksong is the sequel to the indie Metroidvania title, Hollow Knight, which is regarded by many to be one of the best Xbox games in modern times, despite being seven years old at this point (originally released in 2017). Fans and critics loved it for its challenging gameplay, superb macabre artstyle, expansive dark world rife with secrets, and engrossing soundtrack. Hollow Knight: Silksong was first announced in 2019 as a DLC expansion for Hollow Knight but has gradually grown in scale to become a fully-fledged sequel instead. In addition, from what has been shown in the trailers, Hollow Knight: Silksong is set to expand upon all the traits that made the original Hollow Knight beloved while introducing a new main character to play as and a new world to explore. The anticipation and wait for this upcoming Xbox title has been long and arduous, with Hollow Knight: Silksong stuck in development for five years at this point.

Main opposition Democratic Party leader Lee Jae-myung speaks to reporters after exit polls indicated his party and its allies would have a larger majority in the new legislature [Chung Sung-Jun/Reuters] Published On 10 Apr 2024 10 Apr 2024 | Updated : 10 Apr 2024 01:38 PM (GMT) South Korea’s main opposition Democratic Party (DP) and its allies are projected to increase their majority by winning up to 197 seats in the single-chamber, 300-seat legislature, a joint exit poll by three major television networks shows. Wednesday’s elections were seen as a referendum on President Yoon Suk-yeol as voters expressed frustration about the cost of living and corruption. Voting ended at 6pm (09:00 GMT). Keep reading list of 4 items list 1 of 4 Doctors’ strike, Dior bags, onions: South Korea’s parliamentary elections list 2 of 4 South Korea puts second military spy satellite successfully into orbit list 3 of 4 North Korea fires suspected intermediate-range ballistic missile list 4 of 4 South Korea’s Yoon accuses doctors of running ‘cartel’ as strike drags on end of list The exit poll by TV stations KBS, MBC and SBS suggested that the DP and its allies were forecast to win a combined 183 to 197 seats in the National Assembly. It also projected that Yoon’s ruling People Power Party (PPP) and its satellite party would win 85 to 100 seats. If confirmed, these results would deal a massive blow to the president and make him a lame duck for his remaining three years in office. “Certainly one thing is clear: This is not a good night for the president,” said Al Jazeera’s Eunice Kim, reporting from the capital, Seoul. Counting is still under way across the country, and the election watchdog has said each ballot will be counted twice to ensure nothing is missed, she added. If the projection holds, the opposition could potentially win more than 200 seats, which would give it a super majority in the National Assembly, Kim reported. Rebuilding Korea, a liberal splinter party led by former Justice Minister Cho Kuk, was also forecast to secure 12 to 14 seats, according to the exit poll, for which nearly 360,000 voters were interviewed nationwide. National Election Commission officials count ballots in Seoul [Kim Soo-hyeon/Reuters] The Yonhap news agency reported that voter turnout was the highest in 32 years with 29.6 million people, or 67 percent of the 44.2 million eligible voters, casting ballots. It cited figures from the National Election Commission just after polling stations closed. Turnout in 1992 was 71.9 percent. It would mark the highest ever turnout for a parliamentary election, but the numbers were down from the 2022 presidential vote, which narrowly brought Yoon to power. South Korea’s 254 parliament members are elected through direct votes in local districts and the 46 other seats are allotted according to party support. Yoon, who narrowly beat the DP’s Lee Jae-myung in the presidential race in 2022, has struggled to push through his conservative policies and is under pressure over a weeks-long doctors strike, which has forced operations to be cancelled. He is unpopular as a result of the “lack of real progress on domestic political and economic issues”, Andrew Yeo, a politics professor at the Catholic University of America, told the Agence France-Presse (AFP) news agency. “Prices and inflation remain high, housing is expensive and political polarisation remains high.” Corruption and disaffection Moon Chung-in, a professor at Yonsei University, told Al Jazeera that the possible opposition landslide victory “is quite surprising” because it was expecting to win a narrow majority of 151 seats. Moon said the president’s leadership style also did not help during the campaign, adding that he has failed to deliver on his campaign promises of national unity and consensus. The DP has a majority in the outgoing assembly and has criticised Yoon and his conservative PPP for mismanaging the economy and failing to rein in inflation. A village schoolmaster and his family vote in Nonsan in South Korea [Yonhap/via Reuters] PPP leader Han Dong-hoon, meanwhile, said a big win by the DP, whose leader is facing corruption charges, would create a crisis for the country. Rebuilding Korea has emerged as a dark horse and is projected to win at least a dozen seats despite offering few substantive policies. “I am going to make President Yoon first a lame duck, then a dead duck,” Cho told AFP this month. Cho is himself facing jail time for corruption charges that he denies. Lee is also on trial for fraud while Yoon has been embroiled in a scandal over his wife’s decision to accept a designer Dior bag as a gift and the appointment of a former defence minister as South Korea’s ambassador to Australia while he was under investigation for corruption. Before the elections, analysts said demographics could help Yoon as voters aged 60 and older – seen as more conservative – now outnumber those in their 20s and 30s. Many younger voters are less likely to vote with many saying they are put off by a political class dominated by older men who ignore their concerns. They are also struggling economically with cut-throat competition in education, fewer job opportunities and sky-high housing costs. Yoon has three more years to serve of his single term in office. The National Assembly will serve a four-year term.

An Excavation Investigation ‘Exhuma’: Let’s Dig Into the Surprise Success of South Korea’s Biggest Hit of the Year (So Far) Filmmaker Jang Jae-hyun's third feature has handily knocked off massive American hits and is coming for another homegrown talent's box office crown.

This week: it expands in the United States. Just one week into its release, “Exhuma” became the highest-grossing Korean film of 2024 so far, knocking the Timothée Chalamet-starring “Wonka” off the top spot following its delayed release there. Chalamet’s other big film of the moment, “Dune: Part Two,” placed second in Korea for three successive weekends in the wake of “Exhuma” too. Related Stories Taylor Swift Ends ‘Tortured Poets Department’ with ‘Clara Bow’ — Who Was She? The 10 Best Doppelganger Films, from ‘Dead Ringers’ to ‘Vertigo’ That means that, nearly a month in, “Exhuma” has made $67.8 million with sales of 9.3 million tickets, crossing the nine million admissions mark four days faster than last year’s most-viewed Korean movie, a historical drama titled “12.12: The Day.” That makes “Exhuma” the most successful Korean occult horror film by far, and also places it among the top 25 biggest box office hits the country has ever seen. It won’t be long until “Exhuma” passes the 10 million — and maybe even 11 million — mark in South Korea, which means at this rate, director Jang Jae-hyun’s third feature is on track to overtake not just one, but potentially three legendary Bong Joon Ho hits: “Snowpiercer,” “Parasite,” and “The Host,” respectively. Weirder things have happened, and to be fair, “Exhuma” itself is pretty weird, too, with some of its supernatural shenanigans, but how did we get here in the first place? What is it about “Exhuma,” in particular, that’s dug so deep into the nation’s collective consciousness? It’s worth noting that Jang is not quite a renowned director in the same way that director Bong is, although that’s set to now change following the success of “Exhuma.” His debut feature, 2015’s “The Priests,” performed well with over 5 million ticket sales, landing it a spot in the top 75 highest-grossing Korean films of all time. But his follow-up, “Svaha: The Sixth Finger,” didn’t reach those same heights (although it was still a number one hit domestically in 2019). Both films dabble in the occult, and both also star big names such as “Parasite” star Park So-dam and Emmy-winning “Squid Game” lead Lee Jung-jae. The same is also true of “Exhuma,” which includes Choi Min-sik, the internationally acclaimed star of “Oldboy,” who has continued to draw in big audiences across the two decades that followed, most notably in South Korea’s highest-grossing film ever, 2014’s “The Admiral: Roaring Currents.” His feng shui master is joined by “Little Women” star Kim Go-eun, whose star is very much on the rise, and Lee Do-hyun, whose recent run of TV hits in “Sweet Home,” “The Glory,” and “The Good Bad Mother” has led him here to his first big feature role. The stars have quite literally aligned for this film, but that alone doesn’t explain the already enduring success of “Exhuma.” Homegrown horror films like “Train to Busan” and “A Tale of Two Sisters” have long resonated with Korean audiences, and that’s especially true of occult fare including Na Hong-jin’s “The Wailing” and Kim Seong-sik’s recent hit “Dr. Cheon and the Lost Talisman” — not to mention Jang’s own previous films, too. In a country in which various religions and traditions co-exist, including shamanism, Buddhism, and Christianity, there’s something particularly fascinating about the way these different faiths intersect today in modern Korean society. ‘Exhuma’ Courtesy Everett Collection “Exhuma” taps into this very specifically Korean take on spirituality with its story of a shaman and her team working to protect the baby of a wealthy Korean American family from a generational curse. Kim Go-eun’s eerie exhumation rituals involve all kinds of loud, tumultuous prayers and singing which are captivating, sure, but it’s the attention to detail in smaller moments that really help ground the exorcisms that local Korean audiences know and recognize — like when the feng shiu specialist tastes the soil to determine the land’s quality or when the undertaker removes gold ornaments from an open coffin. In the wake of the success of “Exhuma,” The Korea Times even published an article about these burial customs and why the “myoji” (or grave tablets) with which the deceased are buried remain so important, both as a sacred tribute to the departed and also as a valuable historical record of life in previous eras. Horror is amplified tenfold when the world it’s set in feels more real, so by digging into these Korean-specific historical influences (including an emerging anti-Japanese motif), “Exhuma” channels believable horrors to ground the story’s weirder aspects with frightening precision. “Exhuma” isn’t entirely unique in that approach, but few films of recent years have managed this so effectively, and with so much talent both in front of and behind the camera to boot. Yet that still doesn’t quite account for the film’s success beyond South Korea. Across the past month, “Exhuma” has already become the highest-grossing Korean film of all time in various Asian territories, including Vietnam and Indonesia, smashing records with ease. Following those lucrative runs abroad, success in North America seems likely too. After grossing $65,000 across just three Los Angeles area screens in the past week, it seems “Exhuma” has the potential to become America’s next big Asian crossover hit with the film’s expanded release this week. Admittedly, the international reviews published so far haven’t been quite as positive as you might expect, averaging out at 71 percent currently on Rotten Tomatoes . But that’s just from seven reviews so far, and 89 percent of user ratings are positive with a current average of 4.5 out of 5. It’s the positive word-of-mouth that will help “Exhuma” more in the long run anyway, and that’s especially true of genre fare like this which often has a better shot at translating to international success. Horror tropes are universal to a degree — everyone gets scared — and the visual aspect can help entice casual cinema-goers more resistant to subtitled cinema. South Korean films, in particular, have a strong reputation for horror, and then there’s also the fact that scary movies, in general, continue to be more reliable audience draws — not to mention moneymakers — post-COVID. Think “Five Nights at Freddy’s,” “Scream VI,” and “M3GAN,” just to name a few from last year. It’s not just international horror that fares well at the North American box office these days either. Last year alone, Japan’s “The Boy and the Heron” and “Godzilla Minus One” grossed $56 million and $46 million domestically even before they both won Oscars this March. Indian crossover hits like “RRR” and “Pathaan” are making an impact, too, signaling a newfound openness to foreign language cinema in the West. Whether that’s due to the improved accessibility of these films via streaming or whether it’s just a natural result of IP blockbuster fatigue, this all means that “Exhuma” has a real shot at crossing over big time, building upon its record-breaking run in Asia and Korea, especially. It doesn’t hurt that this crossover appeal is baked into the film itself — “Exhuma” actually starts with Hwa-rim and Bong-gil flying to L.A. — so don’t be surprised if Jang Jae-hyun’s smash hit wanders overseas like a particularly determined spirit and starts burning its way through the American box office.

Here’s how it works . Microsoft Microsoft flags deceptive strategies and AI-generated disinformation from China that could potentially disrupt the upcoming US election News By Kevin Okemwa published 8 April 2024 China is reportedly using AI-generated images, videos, and memes to misinform voters about the elections and brew outrage in the US, South Korea, and India. Comments (0) (Image credit: Getty Images) What you need to know Microsoft has published a report highlighting how China is leveraging AI to disrupt elections across South Korea, India, and the US. The tech giant details that China's threat to the electoral process "remains low" but warns it could get severe with time as its deceitful ploys become more sophisticated. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella had previously indicated that there's enough power to protect the integrity of the US presidential election, alongside the company's plan to empower voters with authoritative news regarding the election via Bing. With the prevalence of generative AI and chatbots, misinformation is becoming more widespread. Microsoft recently shared a new report highlighting how China is misappropriating the tech, spanning from AI-generated memes designed to fuel outrage over Japan's disposal of nuclear wastewater to spreading malicious rumors indicating that the US government is behind the tragic wildfire in Hawaii and Kentucky's train derailment. According to the tech giant: "As populations in India, South Korea and the United States head to the polls, we are likely to see Chinese cyber and influence actors, and to some extent North Korean cyber actors, work toward targeting these elections." Further in the report, Microsoft indicated that it anticipates China will leverage AI-based ploys to interfere with high-profile elections this year. Several social media accounts believed to belong to Chinese users have been spotted spreading politically concocted AI-generated information. Moreover, the accounts would ask followers to interact with the posts by asking which presidential candidate they are supporting. Microsoft speculates that China intends to use its position and AI to brew more chaos, ultimately allowing it to benefit from the high-profile elections. While the tech giant indicates the issue isn't severe, it warns the situation is highly likely to change: "While the impact of such content in swaying audiences remains low, China's increasing experimentation in augmenting memes, videos and audio will continue – and may prove effective down the line." Microsoft's report complements the US Office of the Director of National Intelligence's threat assessment of China. Both reports mentioned Storm-1376, a Beijing-based group known as "Spamouflage" that is believed to be behind Taiwan's electoral process disruptions via AI-generated content.

What's Microsoft doing to prevent the issue from becoming widespread? (Image credit: Daniel Rubino | Bing Image Creator) Last year, Microsoft Copilot (formerly Bing Chat) was spotted misleading voters and users with false information regarding the forthcoming US election . Researchers indicated that the issue was systemic, after establishing a pattern. The chatbot had also been spotted providing false information about the election process in Germany and Switzerland. But Microsoft has been putting elaborate measures and ramping up it efforts to prevent this situation from spiraling out of control. Earlier this year while in speaking in an interview, Microsoft CEO indicated there's 'enough technology' to protect the US presidential election from AI deepfakes and misinformation . Microsoft had already indicated that it plans to empower voters with authoritative and factual election news on Bing ahead of the poll. Bing growth continues to stagnate despite Microsoft's hefty investment in AI, while Google dominates the search landscape .

Fumio Kishida (right) has previously said he wants to hold talks with Kim Jong Un (left) 'without any preconditions' [File: AFP] Published On 25 Mar 2024 25 Mar 2024 North Korea has claimed that Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida requested a summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un but said any meeting was unlikely without a policy shift by Tokyo. There was no immediate comment from Japan’s government on Monday. Keep reading list of 4 items list 1 of 4 North Korea claims progress in development of hypersonic missile list 2 of 4 North Korea’s Kim oversees ‘super-large’ rocket launcher drills list 3 of 4 After success of BTS and Parasite, South Korea woos digital nomads list 4 of 4 North Korea fires ballistic missiles as Blinken visits Seoul end of list In the statement carried by state media, Kim’s sister and senior official, Kim Yo Jong, said Kishida used “another channel” to convey his position that he wants to meet the North Korean leader in person at an early date. Kim Yo Jong said there would be no breakthrough in North Korea-Japan relations as long as Kishida’s government raises the issue of Japanese citizens abducted to North Korea in past decades and opposes what she described as the North’s “exercise of sovereign rights,” apparently referring to Pyongyang’s weapons testing activities. “If Japan continues to try to interfere with our exercise of our sovereign rights, and continues to be preoccupied with the abduction issue, of which there is nothing more to resolve or investigate, then the prime minister’s [offer for talks] will inevitably be labelled as just an attempt to improve his popularity,” she said. “As long as Japan is hostile toward [North Korea] and infringes our sovereign rights, we will consider it as an enemy that is within our target, not as a friend,” Kim Yo Jong said. “The prime minister should know that he won’t be able to meet the leadership of our country just because he wants to or just because he’s determined to.” In February, Kim Yo Jong issued a similar statement on bilateral ties, saying North Korea was open to improving relationships with Japan and even inviting Kishida to Pyongyang. But she said those would be possible only if Tokyo “drops its bad habit of unreasonably pulling up [North Korea] over its legitimate right to self-defense and does not lay such a stumbling block as the already settled abduction issue”. Kishida has previously said he wants to hold talks with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un “without any preconditions” and is personally overseeing efforts to realise the first such leaders’ summit in 20 years. Japanese media reported on Monday he said he was not aware of the North Korean announcement when he was asked about it in parliament. Some experts say North Korea is seeking to improve ties with Japan as a way to weaken a trilateral Tokyo-Seoul-Washington security partnership, while Kishida also wants better ties with North Korea to increase his declining approval rating at home. The United States and South Korea have been expanding their military drills and trilateral exercises involving Japan in response to North Korea’s accelerating weapons tests. The North Korean weapons tested in recent years included nuclear-capable missiles designed to strike key facilities in Japan as well as those in South Korea and the mainland US. North Korea and Japan do not have diplomatic ties, and their relations have been overshadowed by Pyongyang’s nuclear programme, its past abduction of Japanese nationals and Japan’s 1910-45 colonisation of the Korean Peninsula. After years of denial, North Korea acknowledged in an unprecedented 2002 summit between Kim Jong Il, the late father of Kim Jong Un, and then-Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi that its agents had kidnapped 13 Japanese, mainly to train spies in Japanese language and culture. It allowed five of them to return to Japan that year but said the others had died. Japan thinks at least some of them may still be alive, and believes hundreds more may also have been abducted.

He made his remarks on the same day as rival South Korea’s parliamentary elections on Wednesday, in which the governing party suffered a major defeat , the official Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) said on Thursday.

North Korea has, in recent months, stepped up its accusations against South Korea and its ally, the United States, for what it called provoking military tensions by conducting “war manoeuvers” and holding military drills with greater intensity and scale. In March, Kim also ordered heightened war preparations after inspecting troops at a major military operations base in the country’s west. North Korea “should be more firmly and perfectly prepared for a war, which should be won without fail, not just for a possible war”, he added. Since the election of South Korean President Yoon Suk-yeol in 2022, tensions between the two Koreas have been intensifying, with the North declaring the South as its “principal enemy”. In response to Yoon’s hardline stance towards the North, Kim ordered the scrapping of agencies dedicated to reunification and outreach, and threatened war over “even 0.001mm” of territorial infringement. ‘Death blow’ Kim said, if provoked, North Korea will “deal a death blow to the enemy without hesitation by mobilising all means in its possession”. Partially blurred images released by state media showed him surrounded by army officials, inspecting what appeared to be a miniature of South Korea’s capital Seoul, including its Han River, along with maps of the peninsula. South Korea’s Yoon had taken a tough line with the nuclear-armed North while improving ties with the US. North Korea has been increasing its weapons development under Kim and has forged closer military and political ties with Russia. It has also been accused of aiding Russia in its war with Ukraine. In March, Russia used its veto power at the United Nations Security Council to effectively end UN expert monitoring of North Korean sanctions violations. Earlier this month, Kim supervised the test launch of a new hypersonic intermediate-range ballistic missile using solid fuel, which analysts said would bolster the North’s ability to deploy missiles more effectively than liquid-fuel variants.

Japan nappy maker shifts from babies to adults - BBC News BBC Homepage Skip to content Accessibility Help Your account Home News Sport Earth Reel Worklife Travel More menu More menu Search BBC Home News Sport Earth Reel Worklife Travel Culture Future Music TV Weather Sounds Close menu BBC News Menu Home Israel-Gaza war War in Ukraine Climate Video World Asia UK Business Tech More Science Entertainment & Arts Health World News TV In Pictures BBC Verify Newsbeat Business Market Data New Tech Economy Technology of Business CEO Secrets Artificial Intelligence Paths to Success Japan nappy maker shifts from babies to adults Published 27 March Share close panel Share page Copy link About sharing Image source, Getty Images Image caption, Births are at an all-time low in Japan, while its elderly population is growing By Mariko Oi Business reporter A Japanese nappy maker has announced that it will stop producing diapers for babies in the country and, instead, focus on the market for adults. Oji Holdings is the latest firm to make such a shift in a rapidly ageing Japan, where birth rates are at a record low. Sales of adult nappies outpaced those for infants in the country for more than a decade. The number of babies born in Japan in 2023 - 758,631 - was down by 5.1% from the previous year. It was also the lowest number of births on record in Japan since the 19th Century. In the 1970s, that figure stood at more than two million. In a statement , Oji Holdings said its subsidiary, Oji Nepia, currently manufactures 400 million infant nappies annually. Production has been falling since 2001, when the company hit its peak - 700 million nappies. Back in 2011, Japan's biggest diaper maker, Unicharm, said its sales of adult diapers had surpassed those for babies. Meanwhile, the adult diaper market has been growing and is estimated to be worth more than $2bn (Â£1.6bn). Japan now has one of the world's oldest populations, with almost 30% of them aged 65 or older. Last year, the proportion of those aged above 80 surpassed 10% for the first time . Oji Holdings also said it would continue to make baby diapers in Malaysia and Indonesia where it expects demand to grow. Asia is spending to boost birth rates - will it work? Japan was the future but it's stuck in the past A shrinking population, the result of both ageing and plummeting birth rates, has become a crisis for Japan, one of the world's largest economies. But the Japanese government's efforts to address these challenges have met with little success so far. Increased spending on child-related programmes and subsidies targeting young couples or parents don't appear to be boosting birth rates. Expert say the reasons are complex, ranging from lower marriage rates and more women joining the workforce, to the increased costs of raising children. "Japan is standing on the verge of whether we can continue to function as a society," Prime Minister Fumio Kishida said last year, adding that it was a case of "now or never". But Japan is not alone. Fertility rates have also been dropping in Hong Kong, Singapore, Taiwan and South Korea, the last of which has the lowest birth rate in the world. China too saw its population fall for the second year in a row in 2023 and, like Japan, has introduced various incentives to boost birth rates. But an ageing population and the impact of a decades-long one child-policy, which ended in 2015, are creating demographic challenges in China too.

North Korea says Kim Jong Un oversaw test of new hypersonic weapon | Weapons News | Al Jazeera Skip links Skip to Content play Live Show navigation menu Navigation menu News Show more news sections Middle East Africa Asia US & Canada Latin America Europe Asia Pacific Israel War on Gaza Features Opinion Video More Show more sections Economy Ukraine war Coronavirus Climate Crisis Investigations Interactives In Pictures Science & Technology Sport Podcasts play Live Click here to search search News | Weapons North Korea says Kim Jong Un oversaw test of new hypersonic weapon State media said the missile – named Hwasong-16B – was a key piece of the country’s nuclear war deterrent. The Hwasong-16B seen before launch [KCNA via Reuters] Published On 3 Apr 2024 3 Apr 2024 North Korea has said it tested a new solid-fuelled hypersonic intermediate-range missile (IRBM) as it continues to expand its weapons programme. Wednesday’s report in the state-run Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) came a day after South Korea and Japan detected the launch of a missile from North Korea towards the east. Keep reading list of 4 items list 1 of 4 North Korea fires suspected intermediate-range ballistic missile list 2 of 4 Russia blocks renewal of UN panel monitoring North Korea sanctions list 3 of 4 North Korea says Japan’s prime minister proposed summit with Kim list 4 of 4 North Korea claims progress in development of hypersonic missile end of list KCNA shared photos of leader Kim Jong Un on site near the weapon, the Hwasong-16B, as well as with his military commanders, less than two weeks after he supervised a solid-fuel engine test for an IRBM. Kim lauded the weapon as a demonstration of the “absolute superiority” of North Korea’s defence technology. Pyongyang had developed nuclear-capable, solid-fuel systems for “all the tactical, operational and strategic missiles with various ranges”, he added, according to KCNA. The Hwasong-16B is solid-fuelled, which means it can be deployed more quickly than a liquid-fuelled weapon [KCNA via Reuters] The North Korean leader promised to further develop the country’s arsenal to counter his “enemies”, a reference to Japan, South Korea and the United States. KCNA said the Hwasong-16B flew for about 1,000km (621 miles), reaching a peak altitude of 101km (62 miles). Seoul’s military said it was airborne for about 600km (370 miles) before splashing down in the sea between South Korea and Japan. North Korea has focused on developing more sophisticated solid-fuel weapons because they are easier to conceal and move, and can be launched more quickly. Liquid-propelled weapons need to be fuelled before launch and cannot stay fuelled for long periods of time. Hypersonic weapons, meanwhile, are designed to exceed five times the speed of sound and can also be maneouvred in flight. North Korea previously said it tested a hypersonic IRBM in January. The Tuesday launch “appears to be part of Pyongyang’s missile development blueprint, including hypersonic weapons”, said Han Kwon-hee of the Korea Association of Defence Industry Studies. North Korean leader Kim Jong Un said the weapon showed the ‘absolute superiority’ of North Korean military technology [KCNA via Reuters] Analysts say such weapons, if perfected, would be potentially capable of reaching remote US targets in the Pacific, including the island of Guam. “North Korea, in declaring that it has fully accomplished the nuclear weaponisation of its missiles, also emphasised its commitment to arm its hypersonic missiles with nuclear weapons,” Chang Young-keun, a missile expert at South Korea’s Research Institute for National Strategy, told the Associated Press news agency. “North Korea’s development of hypersonic IRBMs targets Guam, which hosts US military bases, and even Alaska.” Tensions in the region have risen since 2022 as Kim used Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine as a distraction to accelerate his testing of missiles and other weapons. The US and South Korea have responded by expanding their combined training and trilateral drills involving Japan and sharpening their deterrence strategies.

‘Mysterious’ surfboard-like object orbiting Moon is South Korean spacecraft | Technology News - The Indian Express Sections English தமிழ் বাংলা മലയാളം ગુજરાતી हिंदी मराठी Business बिज़नेस Newsletters Edition India International Friday, Apr 19, 2024 ePaper Today’s Paper Journalism of Courage Home ePaper Cities India Explained Opinion Business Entertainment Sports Politics UPSC Lifestyle Tech Education Research Videos Subscribe Sign In Trending UPSC Pack IPL Premium Stories Express Shorts Lok Sabha polls Live Mini Games 🎙️ Podcast JAC 10th Result Board Exam Results Advertisement News Technology Science ‘Mysterious’ surfboard-like object orbiting Moon is South Korean spacecraft ‘Mysterious’ surfboard-like object orbiting Moon is South Korean spacecraft The "Moon surfboard" pictured by NASA's LRO was a South Korean spacecraft. By: Science Desk Kochi | April 11, 2024 13:36 IST Follow Us During the next encounter, LRO was closer to Danuri, about 2.5 miles, or 4 kilometers, and oriented 25 degrees toward it. NASA/Goddard/Arizona State University NASA’s Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter clicked a picture of what looked like a “surfboard” orbiting the Moon last month. The space agency said the picture was of Korea Aerospace Research Institute’s Danuri lunar orbiter as the two probes zoomed past each other. LRO’s narrow-angle camera, one in a suite of cameras known as LROC, took this image during one of the three orbits during which it happened to be close enough to Danuri. The relative velocity between these spacecraft was about 11,500 kilometres per hour. This required NASA’s teams to have perfect timing to point LROC in the right direction and take a picture of the Danuri, which is South Korea’s first spacecraft on the Moon. There is a reason for why Danuri has the long slender appearance of a surfboard. LRO’s camera exposure is very short at only about 0.338 milliseconds. But with such a high relative velocity, Danuri appeared 10 times its size opposite to the direction of travel. Danuri is officially called the Korea Pathfinder Lunar Orbiter and it is developed and managed by the Korea Aerospace Research Institute (KARI) and launched in August 20222 to orbit the Moon for a year with both South Korean experiments and one US-built instrument. Its main mission objectives include proving lunar exploration capabilities, demonstrating “space internet,” and conducting scientific research and even identify future landing sites for missions. © IE Online Media Services Pvt Ltd First uploaded on: 11-04-2024 at 13:36 IST Here’s Your Exclusive Pass To Premium Stories CLAIM NOW Latest Comment Post Comment Read Comments Advertisement JAC Jharkhand Board 10th Result 2024: Websites to check JAC Matric scorecard Education Updated: April 19, 2024  12:14 IST Jharkhand Academic Council (JAC) will declare the Class 10 results today (April 19) on their official websites.

Chow April 9, 2024 8:00 AM EDT W hen the author Viet Thanh Nguyen was growing up in California as a refugee from the Vietnam War , depictions of that conflict were omnipresent in American culture. Platoon , Apocalypse Now , Full Metal Jacket , and many other films portrayed American heroes fighting their way through a dystopian backwater and then dealing with the psychic toll of defeat back home. Very few of those films gave much thought to the experiences of the Vietnamese—who themselves refer to the conflict as the American War. It's been 51 years since the last American combat troops departed Vietnam. Nguyen now teaches a class on the war at the University of Southern California, and finds that most of his students—who were born after 2000—haven't seen those movies. But their perspective and themes linger in the air, irrevocably molding the collective memory. " Hollywood has so radically shaped the global understanding of this war and its aftermath," Nguyen says. Nguyen offered a counternarrative with The Sympathizer , his Pulitzer Prize-winning 2015 novel that follows a North Vietnamese spy during and after the war. Now, that book is getting the Hollywood treatment, a miniseries adaptation premiering on HBO on April 14. The A24 production features a mix of big stars, including Robert Downey Jr. , Sandra Oh , and John Cho , and ethnically Vietnamese newcomers, most notably Hoa Xuande in the lead role. Nguyen, who is an executive producer, and the creative team hope the series will force viewers to center the Vietnamese perspective of the conflict while rethinking fundamental American myths, including about how the country still wields its geopolitical power in a fractured world today. "Everything that the United States was doing in 1975 are things that are still happening now," Nguyen says. The Sympathizer tells the story of a half-Vietnamese, half-French communist agent who infiltrates the South Vietnamese military and then embeds in California after the war, hoping to sniff out gestating plots upon his homeland. The novel could hardly have been better received: it won the Pulitzer for fiction and landed on over 30 best-of-2015 lists for its biting wit and ambitious shifts in tone, from thriller to screenplay to satire. But Nguyen, now 53, harbored even grander dreams for his debut novel. "A successful novel might sell tens or hundreds of thousands of copies. But even a bad television series or bad movie would reach millions of people," he says. Hollywood didn't immediately understand his vision. Nguyen says that in early meetings, producers were uneasy about his insistence that the show center Vietnamese people speaking Vietnamese. But the tone shifted following the political unrest during the Trump era, and the murders of George Floyd in 2020 and of six Asian American women in Atlanta in 2021. "Hollywood's liberalism was challenged," Nguyen says. "It took a while for the people with the capacity to make this kind of thing to catch up." Hoa Xuande in The Sympathizer Courtesy of HBO The adaptation was further boosted by the sign-on of co-showrunner Park Chan-wook, the revered South Korean filmmaker behind Oldboy and The Handmaiden , who read The Sympathizer and understood how it connected to his own country's history. As in Vietnam, Korea endured a proxy war between the U.S. and the USSR. South Korean soldiers fought alongside Americans and the South Vietnamese in Vietnam. Their involvement in the war spurred an American economic injection that propelled the South Korean economy toward becoming the juggernaut it is today. Nguyen was thrilled by Park's involvement, as The Sympathizer was inspired by Oldboy in its darkly funny exploration of violence, memory, and revenge. Park, in turn, recognized a kindred spirit. "The way he went about using humor in such an absurd and dire situation, that was very my style," Park says through a translator. Nguyen displayed his dark humor one day on set, during the filming of a movie-within-a-movie that skewers Hollywood's one-dimensional depictions of the war. Nguyen asked to be cast as a nameless Vietnamese villager who gets blown up by the inner movie's American heroes, as a symbol for how casually Hollywood treated mangled Asian bodies. "I just thought it would be appropriate for the author to be killed," Nguyen told me, wryly. Instead, he was inserted into the show as a photographer at a party. The adaptation is fairly faithful to the novel. Park and co-showrunner Don McKellar punched up the spy elements, making Xuande's protagonist, referred to only as the Captain, into more of a noir action hero. That tweak meant that while the character is by no means an angel, he is slightly less brutal than in the novel. A scene in which he wields homophobic tactics to force a confession was altered, for example. "If you make him like Steve McQueen, he's going to be very charming and sexy," McKellar says. "It wasn't to soften him. It just felt natural that in the visual medium, we had to lean into the movie-star appeal more." Robert Downey Jr. in one of his many roles on The Sympathizer Courtesy of HBO Another key decision that Park made was to have several of the white American characters—a Congressman, a filmmaker, a professor, a CIA agent—be played by one single actor. Park hoped to drive home a conceit central to The Sympathizer : that imperialist systems of power are entwined and overlapping. Park's top choice was Robert Downey Jr., who agreed to take on the multifaceted challenge and serve as an executive producer with his wife Susan Downey, under the banner of their production company Team Downey. Downey Jr.'s presence also adds a meta layer of meaning. Many viewers, especially younger ones, know him best as Iron Man , whom Marvel's Stan Lee envisioned as the "quintessential capitalist": a billionaire fighting communism and supplying arms to the U.S. military. Iron Man was first introduced in a 1963 comic, fighting in Vietnam alongside Americans against the racist caricature Wong-Chu, the "red guerrilla tyrant." But Nguyen and Park make clear that The Sympathizer is neither pro-North Vietnam nor anti-America. Some of the novel's searing condemnations are aimed at the Vietnamese government, which led to roadblocks in getting the book published in the country, Nguyen says. McKellar says they tried hard to film in Vietnam—sending hundreds of letters to the censor board—but did not get permission. (They ended up using Thailand as a substitute.) "I expect that [the Vietnamese government] will be pretty unhappy," McKellar says. While The Sympathizer spares no faction from criticism, both the book and series also harbor overt ideological aims. Nguyen is something of a progressive firebrand on social media and in public speaking appearances, and doesn't hide his political goals for the show. Chief among these is challenging audiences to reckon with the corrosive global effects of American power and racism. "There's a general allergy to this idea that literature or art can have any didactic or political function," he says. "I think that's wrong." Nguyen hopes the show will reveal the war's place in American history and its relevance to conflicts still unfolding today. "Americans want to understand their wars as discrete things," Nguyen says. "But if we're talking about these wars in Asia, what we're really talking about is an extension of America's campaign from its very earliest settlement to continue expanding westwards, all the way to China. It's all part of the same history." That history, Nguyen argues, extends to the U.S.'s support of Israel's prolonged assault on Gaza . In October, a week after Hamas' attack on Israel , Nguyen signed a letter criticizing Israel's retaliatory attack on Gaza. The Manhattan venue 92NY pulled Nguyen from a book talk promoting his memoir, A Man of Two Faces . Nguyen says that despite potential repercussions, he was inspired by Martin Luther King Jr., who stumped against the Vietnam War and its "deadly Western arrogance" in 1967. Nguyen penned a foreword to a reprint of that speech this year. "Here was a man who extended his principles from the cause of Black liberation to the cause of being against American imperialism and what he saw as a racist war in Asia and in Vietnam," Nguyen says. "I see Israel's war on Gaza as an opportunity in the same way for moral and political clarity." Nguyen risks drawing the ire of right-wing ideologues—who might dismiss The Sympathizer as the epitome of a liberal Hollywood indoctrination campaign—and of Hollywood itself, which promised greater representation and creative freedom after 2020 but has become increasingly cautious in a moment of corporate consolidation. "I think the show is quite provocative in ways that are pretty unusual in American popular culture," says McKellar. "I keep wondering if HBO understands exactly the land mines that they're walking through here." First and foremost, The Sympathizer aims to succeed as a work of art: to thrill via its haphazard assassination attempts, clandestine romances, and games of cat-and-mouse. But Nguyen also hopes it stirs uncomfortable introspection and helps shift long-standing narratives. "It's gonna be unsettling," he says. "But it's worth the risk if it could be a lever to affect the mass understanding of the war and its impact on Vietnamese people."

Following Mar 25, 2024, 11:53am EDT Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin SEONGNAM, SOUTH KOREA - 2023/09/26: South Korea's Cheongung medium range surface-to-air missile ... [+] system displayed during a ceremony marking the 75th founding anniversary of the country's armed forces day at Seoul Air Base. South Korea's military showcased "high-power" missiles and other key weapons systems on 26 September to mark the 75th founding anniversary of its armed forces in an apparent warning against North Korea's nuclear and military threats. (Photo by Kim Jae-Hwan/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images) SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images Iraq has announced it is again shopping around for new air defense systems, sending committees to several countries to negotiate contracts. While it’s unclear where Baghdad will ultimately acquire these systems, South Korea may prove preferable for several reasons. Iraq is “contracting for weapons and advanced systems,” and “there are technical and military committees that visited a number of countries and made offers to them with access to anti-aircraft weapons,” Iraq’s military spokesperson announced on Mar. 18 . Iraqi Defense Minister Thabet Al-Abbasi met with his South Korean counterpart on Mar. 21 to discuss military cooperation. Of course, none of these recent developments confirms that Baghdad will ultimately opt for a South Korean air defense system. But if it did, it would be preferable to other options. The most significant post-2003 air defense acquisition Iraq made was its 2014 acquisition of medium-range Pantsir-S1 systems from Russia. In the late 2010s and early 2020s, Iraqi officials repeatedly indicated that Baghdad was interested in potentially acquiring advanced S-300 or S-400 long-range missile systems from Moscow. MORE FROM FORBES ADVISOR Best High-Yield Savings Accounts Of 2024 By Kevin Payne Contributor Best 5% Interest Savings Accounts of 2024 By Cassidy Horton Contributor Acquiring Russian systems today would carry many more risks and headaches than just a few years ago. Since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, the supply of Russian weaponry and parts has become much less reliable. Furthermore, Baghdad would risk incurring American sanctions under the CAATSA law if it makes such a sizable order from Moscow, as Turkey did for its order of S-400s. Iraq directly experienced this when it had difficulty sustaining its Russian military helicopters , especially its Mi-17s, which are essential for army operations against the Islamic State. Baghdad has since turned to the United States for alternatives. Systems like the S-400s are far more complex than utility helicopters, so Iraq could not afford to risk spending billions on such an order. The United States is also an option but may not prove optimal. There is a provision in the 2024 National Defense Authorization Act passed by Congress “to equip and train Iraqi security forces and Kurdish Peshmerga forces to defend against attack by missiles, rockets, and unmanned systems.” However, the U.S. may prove reluctant to provide advanced air defenses to Iraq if Baghdad insists U.S.-led coalition troops leave the country. Furthermore, powerful Iran-backed elements in Baghdad may even oppose the acquisition since it stipulates the provision of air defenses to the autonomous Iraqi Kurdistan region. Incidentally, Iraq turned to the United States for air defense systems in 2013. Baghdad requested 40 AN/TWQ-1 Avenger short-range air defense systems and three Hawk-21 batteries, a modernized version of the venerable medium-range MIM-23 Hawk. Ultimately, Iraq, facing other priorities like the subsequent war against the Islamic State, only received eight Avengers , and it’s unclear if it wishes to revive that deal. Iran has previously shown an interest in helping Iraq build up its air defense capabilities and recently expressed interest in holding joint air defense drills with allied states. Iran has also developed some formidable long-range air defenses in recent years that it could offer Baghdad, such as the Bavar-373, which Tehran boasts is more powerful than the S-300 and in the same league as the S-400. The U.S. would likely oppose Iraq obtaining such high-end capabilities from Iran, especially if Iranian personnel operate these advanced systems since they could endanger coalition air operations if there is another round of hostilities between the U.S. military and Iran’s militia proxies. Iraq has received long-range Thales Ground Master 403 (GM403) air surveillance radars from France. Paris would undoubtedly also be willing to sell air defenses to Baghdad. Incidentally, Iraq’s air defenses in the 1980s consisted of Soviet-made missiles integrated under the French-built KARI command, control, and communications system. Baghdad may buy French Mistral or Crotale short-range missiles to supplement its existing Pantsir-S1s, Avengers, and its overall defenses against drones. It could also choose the longer-range SAMP/T, which is more capable against ballistic and cruise missiles. South Korea would undoubtedly be willing to sell its new medium-range Cheongung II KM-SAM to Iraq. After all, it has expressed its hope to sell its upcoming KF-21 Boramae fighter to Iraq , which previously bought 24 T-50 Golden Eagle supersonic jet trainers. Seoul even built a specific variant of the aircraft for Iraq, the T-50IQ. Furthermore, as previously noted , the KM-SAM is based on the 9M96 missile used by the S-400 and S-350E systems. Consequently, Iraq could acquire a high-end air defense system comparable to the S-400 without any of the political and procurement headaches that comes with buying from Russia. In recent years, the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia have already ordered KM-SAMs as part of multi-billion dollar contracts. For these reasons, South Korea is certainly a strong contender to sell Iraq the most sophisticated air defense system it has acquired in decades. Follow me on Twitter .

The Korean report says that Samsung was unable to reach agreement with Apple on the price of the displays, and so they will instead be made by China’s BOE … iPhone SE 4 We first heard about plans for a major upgrade to Apple’s entry-level phone in November of last year. The company was said to be planning to ditch the Home button and bring the iPhone SE 4 in line with today’s all-screen design. This was corroborated by a subsequent report, stating that Apple will use the display from the iPhone 13 , which is essentially the same as that used in the iPhone 14. We’ve noted before that re-using technology from older iPhones is a good way to minimize costs, as all of the R&D work has already been done and costed into the existing production runs. At the time, Samsung, BOE, and Tianma were said to be competing for contracts to manufacture the displays. Samsung declined, says supply-chain report IT Home today cites a Korean report that all the iPhone SE 4 displays will now be made by China’s BOE, after Samsung withdrew from negotiations. According to South Korean media ZDNet Korea, BOE took the lead in becoming the screen supplier of Apple’s iPhone SE 4, and Samsung showed that it withdrew from the negotiations due to price problems […] Samsung [reportedly] abandoned supply negotiations for price reasons in the middle of this month, mainly because Apple’s price was only $25. Samsung’s previous offer was $30. The report says that Tianma failed to show that it could meet Apple’s quality standards for the display, so BOE has now been awarded the sole contract. Some risk, but neither company will be too unhappy The switch to BOE does introduce some level of risk. Samsung, which previously made the displays for the iPhone 13 and 14, will have ironed out all the production line challenges, enabling it to achieve high yields from the start. While BOE can take the lessons learned from Samsung, there are still likely to be some glitches along the way to mass production. Apple also generally likes to have multiple suppliers, both to reduce risk and to maximize its negotiating power. But given that this isn’t a flagship product, and Apple wasn’t able to get its way on price with Samsung, it will likely be satisfied with the outcome. Samsung, too, has clearly made the decision that it doesn’t make commercial sense to take razor-thin margins on an older product when it has a strong revenue stream making displays for flagship iPhones.

North Korean leader Kim Jong Un attends Tuesday's test [KCNA via Reuters] Published On 20 Mar 2024 20 Mar 2024 North Korea has successfully tested a solid-fuel engine for its new-type intermediate-range hypersonic missile. State media reported the development on Wednesday, suggesting progress in Pyongyang’s efforts to develop a more powerful, agile missile that could be capable of hitting further away targets in the region including Guam, a territory of the United States.

KCNA cited Kim as saying that the strategic value of the intermediate-range missile was as important as intercontinental ballistic missiles targeting the US mainland and that “enemies know better about it”. It added that a timetable for completing the development of the new weapons system was “set through the great success of the important test”. Kim announced in 2021 that he wanted to modernise the military and announced a series of technologically-advanced weapons systems, including a hypersonic missile, that North Korea planned to develop. The country conducted a test of an intermediate-range hypersonic missile in January which it said involved a new solid-fuel engine. KCNA did not elaborate on the engine tested on Tuesday or reveal the technical nature of the test. Solid-fuel missiles can be launched more quickly than their liquid-fuelled counterparts and are easier to move and conceal, which theoretically makes them harder to detect. Hypersonic weapons are designed to fly at speeds in excess of five times the speed of sound. If perfected, such systems could potentially pose a challenge to regional missile defence systems because of their speed and manoeuvrability. Pyongyang’s latest announcement came a day after North Korea said Kim oversaw drills involving “ newly-equipped super-large ” multiple rocket launchers. North Korea has been engaged in a provocative run of missile tests since 2022. The US and South Korean militaries have responded by expanding their bilateral exercises and trilateral drills involving Japan.
